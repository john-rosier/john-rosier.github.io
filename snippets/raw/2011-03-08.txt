Letter "Q"

Hi Grandkids,  Here's my prayer for today ........  Lord, when 
troubles descend on us we sometimes Question why??
Help me to accept and believe in your promise that all things work 
together for good to those who love the Lord.
SNIPPET "Q"; Quick on the draw.  In june 2006, Deb, Kim, Donno and I 
had a fantastic trip to China.  I finally got to walk on the Great 
Wall of China!  We wound up our trip in Shanghai and our stay in the 
5-star Westin Hotel.  It was the most posh hotel we had ever been 
in.  Our Tour Group travelled in five busses (each time we debarked 
from our Viking River Cruise Ship).  The busses took us to the wide 
promenade along the Yangtze River in downtown Shanghai.  There were 
many other busses parked there and hundreds of foreign tourists plus 
Chinese peddlers strolling on the promenade.  As we walked, I 
noticed a U.S. $2 bill on the pavement.  It was folded with a paper 
clip around it.  Some Chinese peddler also spotted it, but I was 
quicker on the draw to scoop it up.  When we returned to the bus a 
couple of hours later, I took the paper clip off and as shocked to 
find that the $2 bill was folded around two $100 bills and one $50 
bill.  I asked on our bus if anyone had lost some bills folded with a 
paper clip.  Our Tour Guide said there was no way to locate the 
rightful owner other than someone on our bus ... so, my quick draw 
netted $252.  That's about s much as I earned in my first 16 weeks of 
employment at Swift!
Love, Boppa
