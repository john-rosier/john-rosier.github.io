ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 33:
"Father the heavens were made by your word, let all the earth fear you, let all the people of the world revere you."

A couple of weeks ago we wrote about the terrorist attacks at Charlie Hebdo.  Today I'd like to write about the Boko Haram terrorism in Nigeria.  Nigeria, with its 174 million inhabitants, is the largest country in Africa and it's people are about 47% Christian and 46% Muslim.  Also, did you know  that the Christian Reformed Denomination in Nigeria has about 160,000 members (as compared to about 250,000 in our North American Denomination)?  The literal translation of Boko Haram is "Western Education is Forbidden".  You probably remember that Boko Haram got the world's attention last April after kidnapping 276 schoolgirls. There are still 219 missing in spite of a worldwide BRNGBACKOURGIRLS  twitter campaign.  Nigeria is a country plagued by corruption, sectarian violence, and human rights abuses.  A couple of weeks ago, Boco Haram showed up in Baga, the last government-controlled  town in Nigeria's far north.  Armed with AK-47's and rocket propelled grenades. they overran the military base there and murdered up to 2,000 civilians.  Their latest strategy is employing 10-year-old girls as suicide bombers.  Last week one of these young girls detonated an explosive hidden under her veil in a marketplace in Maidugari. killing over 20 people.  How can a terrorist group as vile as this be able to recruit from both teenagers and the 20 to 30 age group via social media?  It blows my mind and I hope my great grandkids never get to see the Muslims multiply to over 50% of the U.S. population (I don't doubt that some European countries will experience that).  On  February 14 a presidential election takes place in Nigeria pitting the incumbent, Goodluck Johnathon (a Christian, albeit far from saintly} against Muhammadu Buhari.  Stay tuned.
Love, Boppa John
