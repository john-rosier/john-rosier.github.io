CHINA'S LATEST PROBLEM

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 111:
"Lord, all we who are thankful should think about and ponder all you have done.  For your miracles demonstrate your honor, majesty and eternal goodness.  We give you thanks, O God."

Lately,it seems like I've been picking on China quite a bit.  Maybe it's because they've been in the news so much.  Since they have now revoked their "One child per family" law which was established in the 1970's, they have a two-fold problem:  1)  They now have too few young people supporting a graying population.  2)  They have an estimated 12 million inhabitants who are living in limbo because
they were never documented when born (due to the harsh consequences bestowed on having more than the allotted  one child).  This group is unable to go to school or receive medical care.  Here's a
little-known coincidence, the USA and China are nearly the same size geographically.  The U.S has 3.8 million square miles compared to China's 3.7 million square miles.  Of course, many are aware that China's population of 1.4 billion is almost five times that of the U.S.'s  320 million.  As it turns out, China probably would have made out just as well without the one child law.  Birth rates fell everywhere  because the world urbanized and grew in affluence.  Couples living in cramped city apartments don't want as many kids.  In 1970,  China's birthrate was 33 births per 1,000 population.  By 1998 that fell to 15 births per 1,000.  But, during the same period and without any restrictive laws, South Korea's rate fell from 31 per 1,000 in 1970, down to 14 per 1,000 in 1998;  and Thailand's fell from 37 per 1,000 to 14 per 1,000.  So there you have it...China's grotesque intrusion into the intimate lives of their citizens produced decades of compulsory sterilization and forced abortions, and, in hindsight could be considered a bust.  But, because of the "made-in-China" label on almost all toys from Amazon, my seven Great Grand Kids will enjoy an abundance of toys this Christmas.
