Letter "O"

Hi Grandkids,  This is my prayer today   ....  Lord, let me recognize Opportunities to witness.  Give me the courage and wisdom to use these opportunities to tell others about your marvelous plan of salvation,
SNIPPET:  Opera Czar.  Who would ever guess that in the autumn of 1945, a 21-year old farm boy from Evergreen Park would be the Opera Czar of Munich, Germany?  Here's how it happened.  Harry Truman had dropped the Atomic Bomb on Japan, so we no longer had to train to execute a D-Day assault on the beaches of Japan.  Thanks to Harry, we saved the lives of thousands of GI's. probably including mine.  I got a ten-day leave to the French Riviera.  While there, I became friends with a Captain who was the Adjutant of the 38th Brigade which ran the Munich area.  His leave expired a couple of days before mine and he said that when he returned to duty he'd try to find a better assignment for me  Sure enough, when I returned there were orders putting me in charge of the Munich Opera House and Munich's Outdoor Ice Arena.  I rounded up some of the ex-opera performers and since all of the costumes and scenery were there, we produced OTHELLO, LA BOHEME, and Wagner's TANNHAUSER.  I invited my closest friends to join me in the prestigious Czar's box.  As for the Ice Arena, I bummed a batch of silk parachutes from the Air Force and gave them to some local German dress designers.  They dyed then and made costumes for some well-attended Ice Shows.
I also advertised in the Stars and Stripes for hockey players and organized a U.S. Hockey team to play some ad hoc 
German Teams.  Unlike Joseph Stalin's "Berlin Wall" mentality, Generals Eisenhower and Marshall wanted us in the Army of Occupation to get the German Citizenry sold on the freedoms and perks of a democratic type of government. I was glad to contribute to this plan with my meager efforts in Munich.     Love, Boppa
