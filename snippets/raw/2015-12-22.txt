OUR GOD OF CREATIVITY

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 93:
"Lord, we shout for joy and praise your name with music for you are our Lord and King!"

Every time I read something that extols the creativity that God has incorporated in his forming of the earth, it blows my mind.  Like giving the monarch butterfly a pinhead sized brain that functions so well that these beautiful creatures can migrate down to Mexico and hibernate for the winter on the same tree that their great, great ancestors used over the many years.  This week I read about a Seal's whiskers.  Seals are carnivores and feed on fish, shrimp, or squid  and how they find their prey has long puzzled Scientists.  Some marine animals, like dolphins and whales. use echolocation.  This is  a kind of internal solar system that allows them to determine the location of their prey by measuring how long it takes an echo to bounce back from it.  Some German Zoologists conducted experiments to determine if the seals had movement-sensitive (hydrodynamic) whiskers to help them find their prey.  The researchers trained two seals to search for the trail left by a miniature submarine.  Even blindfolded, the seals found the trail and tracked it to the submarine over 80% of the time.  When their whiskers were covered, however, they never found the sub.  The seal's whiskers could successfully locate prey over 600 feet away.  I am reminded that in this Advent Season, we often recall how God provided a special star for the Magi to follow and locate the baby Jesus from miles and miles away.
I have empathy for my fellow Americans who are atheists. They believe that the guiding star and Magi are just fiction.  And, where creative wonders,such as the butterfly's pinhead sized brain and the seal's whiskers are concerned, these are just part of the instant process of the great bang theory.
Anyhow,, I  want to wish all of you a Blessed and Merry Christmas.
Love, Boppa John
