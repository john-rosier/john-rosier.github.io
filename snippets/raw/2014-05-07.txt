DINNER WITH DIANNE SAWYER

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 89:
"Lord we praise you, for righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.  Love and faithfulness go before you."

I usually rolled out of bed about an hour before Jean and had showered, shaved and consumed my two cups of coffee and two slices of sodium-free toast before she awoke.  For lunch each day I have a bowl of sodium-free sugared Mini-Wheats.  We, of course, always had dinner together and that's when I miss her most.  However, in keeping with my determination to have the right PMA (positive mental attitude) I am now content to have dinner with Dianne Sawyer and the World News at 5:30 PM.  The reason I bring up this trivia is that it occurred to me how different our "news-gathering" practices are today than they were in the '30s,'40s and '50s.  While preparing dinner from 5:00 to 5:30 I have the local ABC News on;  then from 6:00 to 6:30, while waiting for Wheel of Fortune, I'm again watching the news.  Before going to bed, I'm watching the news again from 9:00 to 10:00.  While growing up, there were just 15 minutes of news on the radio, and that occurred from 10:00 to 10:15 PM.  All of the stations carried the news at the same time so it was just a matter of picking one's favorite Newscaster.  I remember my Dad's favorite was a guy named Gabriel Heatter.  Even during our 3 1/2 year involvement in World War II with an average of about 5,000 young American G.I.s getting killed each month, our media planners stuck to that one 15-minute coverage.  As for visual coverage, there were a couple of Theaters downtown that showed one-hour newsreels and charged about $1.00 to attendees.  News people with 16mm cameras provided this coverage.  I remember seeing them as our outfit was going into combat, but not when we were under enemy fire. So, that's my snippet's "breaking news" for today.      Love, Boppa John
