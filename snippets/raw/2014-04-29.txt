THE INSIDE STORY: WOMEN & SMUGGLERS & POPE FRANCIS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 50:
"Father God, we offer thanksgiving to you, and pay our vows unto you, our most high God."

On television, they'd call this a "slow news day" ... hence this rather weak snippet.  (1)  I read the other day that women account for a record 22% of Legislators worldwide.  It's not surprising that Iran has the lowest number, with only 3.1%.  I was surprised that the United States' total was only 18.6%  (that's below the worldwide average).  Also, of the FORTUNE 500 companies, only 23 have female CEO's. (2)  Now, on to the inside story of how smugglers get creative.  Authorities in Pakistan uncovered a plot to transport heroin inside hollowed out onions to mask the the scent from police dogs.  In Peru, police found frozen squid stuffed with 1,500 lbs. of cocaine.  The squid were  in shipping containers bound for Mexico.  A woman tried to smuggle drugs from Columbia to Spain by hiding cocaine in her breast implants - but wounds on her chest led airport security to send her for a medical exam. Authorities in Lagos caught a Nigerian man trying to smuggle 5.7 lbs. of cocaine from Brazil by stuffing the drug inside roasted chickens.  (3) In naming the 100 most influential people in 2014, the current issue of Time magazine reads,  "Pope Francis reminds us in ways that words alone cannot that no matter our station in life we are bound by moral obligations to one another - we should work to promote peace, to feed the  hungry, shelter the homeless, care for the sick.  His message of love and inclusion, his regard for "the least of these" distills the essence of Jesus" teachings and is a tonic for a cynical age." That's a good piece of advice for all of us.       
Love, Boppa John
