SMOKE: A REAL KILLER

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 127:
"Lord, we praise you for all you do for us.  We know that unless you build the house, its builders labor in vain.  And, unless you watch over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain.

The Chinese Government spends a lot of time and concern about their economy,  They should be more concerned about the fatal effects of smoke and pollution on their citizens.  Recently, Beijing's Mayor, Wang Anshon, has called his city "unlivable" because of its noxious smog. Apparently, this is caused by the pollution of factories and the skyrocketing ownership of motor vehicles.  (I don't give much hope for Mayor Anshon's future after making his derogatory remarks in public).  On top of this
problem, is the growing addiction to cigarette smoking.  To live in China, home to more than 300 million smokers, is to marinate in a haze of tobacco fumes.  Although smoking is declining worldwide, two-thirds of Chinese men light up.  An average pack costs little more than a dollar, so even poor Chinese can afford to smoke.  And, why shouldn't they?  Cigarette ads are found in school publications and Health Clinics!  A new study published in he Medical Journal Lancet, predicts that by 2050, smoking could lead to 3 million deaths a year in China.  Guess what...the world's largest tobacco company, China National Tobacco Corp., which churns out more than 2.5 trillion cigarettes a year, is owned by the Chinese Government and contributes huge revenues to the state.  That's an addiction that may be even harder to quit than smoking,
Love, Boppa John
