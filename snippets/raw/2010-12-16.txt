Letter "E"

Hi Grandkids!  My prayer:  Lord, Everything I have is yours.  Help 
me to be grateful and to use the talents and gifts you have given me 
to honor your name and to help your Kingdom here on earth until that 
day you call me to your Kingdom in heaven.
SNIPPET E:  Education.....when I graduated from the four-room 
Evergreen Park Christian School, my Uncle Mart Ozinga talked my folks 
into sending me to Calumet High School.  Calumet had an R.O.T.C. 
(Reserved Officer's Training Corps).  The advantages were that I 
would get a military uniform to wear two days per week and I would 
receive valuable army training.  After I graduated and worked for 
Swift & Company, I enrolled in Northwestern University's evening 
program located at Chicago Avenue and the Lakefront.  Swift paid the 
tuition and I went to class three nights per week, carrying about six 
credit hours.  I began my stint in World War II about twenty months 
later and couldn't take any additional courses until my discharge in 
1946.  I returned to Northwestern and finally had about the 
equivalent of one year of undergraduate credits.  Some years later I 
found out that the University of Chicago was accepting candidates who 
could pass a three-day G.E.T. test plus the Princeton Entrance Exam. 
I bought and studied a bunch of $1.50 paperbacks from Walgreen's to 
prepare for the G.E.T. test (Philosophy Made Simple,  Astronomy Made 
Simple,  etc.).  I passed the G.E.T. and then took the Princeton. 
They didn't tell me how I scored on the G.E.T. but said I was in the 
upper 18% of the Princeton so I was accepted.  I only carried one 
course per quarter so it took me seven years to get my MBA.
But I've always enjoyed schooling so it really wasn't that big of a 
chore.
Love,  Boppa
