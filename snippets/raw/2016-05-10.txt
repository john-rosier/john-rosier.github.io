TWO DOLLAR, TWENTY-FIVE CENT BASEBALL BARGAIN

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 110:
"Lord, in that day of your power, your people shall come to you willingly, dressed in holy altar robes.  And , your strength shall be renewed day by day like the morning dew."

I've been retired for thirty years.  One of the benefits was attending Cub's games.  Every year I'd order Terrace Reserved seats for $2.25 each...I'd get four tickets for six different dates and Jean and I would go to the games with our friends George and Frieda Hoekstra.  At that time, the White Sox wouldn't let you take anything in the park, but the Cubs had no restrictions.
We could lug in a thermos of coffee, sandwiches, chocolate doughnuts and whatever.  We'd stop at a restaurant for dinner on the way home and have a fun day (especially if the Cubs won).  I'd drop George and the girls and the food off at the entrance to the Park, and then drive about 1/2 mile away to find a free parking place.  When walking to the car after the game, I'd tell our group I was parked two par five and one par four holes away.  In addition, we saw some memorable games:
1)  We happened to be at the game where rookie Kerry Wood tied the all-time record by striking out 20 Houston Astros.
I remember that it was a crisp day and only had a crowd of about 15,000.
2)  The season that the Cubs first had night games (with their new lights) the opening game happened to be rained out.  We had tickets for the next day so we unexpectedly watched the Cubs play their first night game.                                      3)  It would be so cold at the April games that Jean would borrow Wally Ben's sleeping bag (I'd have to physically pull her up from her seat when the Star Spangled Banner was played).  She finally refused to go to any games before May 1.   
Like the song lyrics go, "Those were the days, my Friend;  I thought they'd never end."
Love, Boppa John
