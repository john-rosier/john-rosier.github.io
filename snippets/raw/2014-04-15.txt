ATTITUDE

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 71:
" Lord. I thank you that you do not cast me off in the time of old age; and you do not forsake me when my strength fails."

I have always been amazed by the fact that we have no control over what God has in store for us each day, yet He does give us control of our attitude.  That is such a blessing!  I read the other day that John Newton, who composed the famous hymn, "Amazing Grace," wrote at age 82, "I am still in the land of the dying;
I shall be in the land of the living soon."  That's a good example of having the gift of the right attitude.  For my 90th birthday, Grandson Jon gave me the book "Nearing Home" by Billy Graham.  At the age of 93, Billy writes, "At my age I can sympathize with most seniors.  There are times I long to hike up into the hills with my children or stand in the pulpit to deliver a Gospel message.  But the walker, wheelchair and cane near my bed remind me that chapter in life is past.  So I thank God for the memories that have enriched my life but look forward to new opportunities, to experiences that can add some dimension to the present.  Our attitudes play a major role in the closing scene on life's stage."  Billy's wife Ruth, who passed away several year ago also had an uplifting attitude.  Long before she became bedridden, she was driving along a highway through miles of a construction site. At last she reached a sign that read, "End of Construction.  Thank you for your patience."  She requested that this be carved on her gravestone, and her kids complied with her wishes.  At the age of 90, i'm in a "win/win"
situation.  Each day that I wake up I win another day with my loved ones here on earth.  And. on the day I don't wake up, I'll be with my loved ones who have preceded me to Heaven.  My wish is that God blesses each one of you with the gift of having an upbeat attitude each day.  Love, Boppa John
