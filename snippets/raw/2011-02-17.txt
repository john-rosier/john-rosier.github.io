Letter "N"

Hi Grandkids,  Here's my prayer for today ...... Lord, you've told us 
to love our Neighbors as ourselves.  Help me to always be willing and 
available to assist my neighbors in their daily needs.
SNIPPET "N":  Narrow escape ... I lived about 5 1/2 miles from 
Calumet High School.  When the weather was nice, I'd ride my bike to 
school. In the winter months, I'd ride my bike about a mile to my 
cousin Rich Ozinga's home.  From there, Rich and I would walk about a 
block to Mr. Kamp's house and get a free ride to Calumet.  Mr Kamp 
owned a Butcher Shop in Englewood and his route to work passed our 
school.  Mr Kamp had a deformed spine and measured less than 5 feet 
tall.  When driving, he seemed to be looking through the steering 
wheel as he weaved in and out of traffic in his ten-year old 1931 
Dodge.  Our route took us east on 87th street past the Chicago Park 
District's public toboggan chute and ski jump site.  Our road became 
a steep hill with a railroad crossing at the bottom of the hill.  One 
day, after an early-morning sleet storm, the roads all became 
extremely slippery.  As we approached the hill, Mr Kamp said, 
"There's only one way to keep from spinning out, and that's to step 
on the gas!"  Rich and I broke out in a cold sweat as we roared down 
that hill (a decade before the introduction of seat belts)  But 
guess what, Mr Kamp was right.
We made it down the hill safely.  Love,  Boppa
