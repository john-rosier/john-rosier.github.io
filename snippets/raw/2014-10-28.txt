MORE SLEEP / LESS SUGAR

Dear Family,  My prayer today is from Psalm 149:
"We know, O Lord, that you take delight in your people and you crown the humble with salvation.  Let the Saints rejoice in this honor and sing for joy,"

Since we often have snow in March, we seniors are allowed to take our Driver's License test in the Fall.  So I took and passed the test last week.  Now I'm good  until my 92nd birthday on March 17, 20i6.  Only God knows if I'll still be alive then, but if I am my hope is that I'll still be driving.  A few weeks ago, I wrote about the benefits to the healing part of our brain when we get adequate sleep.  I don't portend to be a geriatric expert, but today I want to write about the benefits of cutting back on our sugar intake.  The typical American eats an average of 128 pounds of added sugar each year.  This intake affects our bodies on every level.  Excess sugar is associated with inflammatory chemicals that raise heart disease risk, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and even certain cancers.  In addition, it also effects signals from our brains.  When normally your brain would tell you you're full, you can't hear it over your sugar buzz, so you keep stuffing yourself.
Lab tests with white rats found that sugar can be very addictive.  The new World Health Organization recommends that we consume just six teaspoons of sugar per day (as opposed to the average American's 22 teaspoon intake).  Sugar has infiltrated so much of our modern food supply that you'll find it where you would never think to look; including healthy cereal, savory salad dressing, and yogurt.  So, I don't expect you to keep a diary on your average sugar intake. 
Just try to cut back on some items by substituting things like diet soda or sugar-free jams, and drinking eight glasses of water daily...because, one of the side effects of too much sugar is being tired all the time (and I want  you to stay awake when you read one of these boring snippets).
Love,  Boppa John
