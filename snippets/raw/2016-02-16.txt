SNOWFLAKES AND DNA

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 89:
"Lord we praise you for the heavens are yours , and yours also is the earth; you founded the world and all that is in it."

As I drove home from church last Sunday morning it was snowing pretty hard.  I must have driven through millions of snowflakes in that six-mile drive.  Since a boy, I had heard the old adage (as I'm sure most of you did) that "No two snowflakes are alike."  It reminded me of an article I once read about a person from Vermont named Wilson Bentley.  As a fifteen-year-old, Bentley was captivated by the intricate beauty of of snow flakes.  His mother had given him an old microscope and he made hundreds of sketches of their remarkable designs, but they melted too quickly to capture their actual detail.  In 1885 he had an idea.  He attached a bellows camera to the microscope, caught a snowflake on a piece of black velvet, and took his first photo.  During his lifetime, Bentley would capture over 5,000 snowflake images and each one was a unique design.  It makes me think of a similar creation...since Adam and Eve, God has created billions of humans, and each one of us has a uniquely designed DNA.  I can understand miracles such as changing water into wine, or healing a leper or a blind person, but I can't wrap my brain around the miracle of creating billions and billions of humans and snowflakes each with a unique design.  Hopefully, when we reach our home in heaven, we'll get a glimpse of the awesome creativity of our Heavenly Father and have a clearer perspective.  Until then, I'm content and thankful for the multitude of blessings he showers upon me each and every day.
Love, Boppa John
