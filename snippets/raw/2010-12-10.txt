Letter "D"

Dear Grandkids,  Here we are in Week 4 and the Letter D...    Lord, 
help me to see your Divine Influence in the Daily Decisions I make. 
May they bring glory to your most high name.
SNIPPET D:  When one looks back from an 86 year longevity perch, 
there's  an awareness of the many  Decisions along the way.  I'll 
just mention two.  In the Spring of 1941, I was interviewed by 
recruiters from three different companies (Back then recruiters 
visited High Schools).  My Dad influenced my decision to take the job 
offered by Swift & Company, the U.S.A.'s largest meat packer.  Even 
during a depression like we were experiencing, "People still have to 
eat," said my Dad.  Good advice!  I started as a Messenger at $15 per 
week on the day I graduated from High School on 6/26/41.  After 45 
years of service, I took Donno's advice and retired at age 62.
The other decision I'll relate occurred  in January 1945.  Another 
2nd Lieutenant and I boarded an army truck along with about 20 
enlisted men to be taken up to join our new outfit, the 61st Armored 
Infantry Battalion of the 10th Armored Division.  I climbed in the 
cab next to the Afro American driver and the other Lieutenant got in 
the back with the troops.  We drove for about 30 minutes and finally 
passed a knocked out U.S. tank that was still smoking.  I asked the 
wild-eyed driver if he was sure he knew where he was going, and he 
said, "No suh."  I told him to stop and turn around and we headed 
back until we saw a jeep with a couple of Military Police.  They 
redirected us and said that if we had gone another 200 or 300 yards, 
we'd have been captured by the Germans.  That may have worked out 
better for the other Lieutenant in the back of the truck....he was 
killed two week later.
Love,  Boppa
