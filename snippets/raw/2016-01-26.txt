AN ALLOUT DRIVE FOR THE CURE

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 56:
"Lord, we praise your name, for you have delivered our souls from death and our feet from stumbling, that we may walk before you, Lord, in the light of life."

Vice President, Joe Biden, has been given the task of trying to bring all of the cancer fighters to work together and share information and collaborate for a cure.  That's a huge order for fiercely territorial and secretive researchers driven by ego and the potential for huge profits.  President Richard Nixon launched a similar effort back in 1971.  Four decades and billions of dollars later, the campaign to diagnose treat and cure cancer is making steady progress.  From 1991 to 2012 (the latest year in which figures are available), the cancer death rate declined 23%.  This huge drop is attributable to powerful new drugs and therapies plus the fact that millions of Americans quit smoking.  Cancer specialist, Dr. DePinho writes,  "Fifty years ago we didn't even know that genes cause cancer.  Then, it took twenty years to identify those which were causing genetic mutations and determine how the immune system works to fight cancer.  Now we have new drugs that can be targeted precisely to patients with specific genetic abnormalities."  Just think how God has blessed our medical researchers in eliminating once seemingly invincible diseases such as smallpox, polio, and diphtheria.  If this new collaborative research effort can develop a simple blood test or another diagnostic tool that can detect cancers at their earliest stages, many treatments will become much more effective.  You and I can join this all out drive for the cure by asking  the Good Lord to bless the efforts of our researchers...add this to your prayer list.
Love,  Boppa John
