ENOUGH TO GO AROUND

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 103:
"Lord, you know we are but dust and that our days are few and brief, like grass and flowers blown by the wind; but your lovingkindness is from everlasting to everlasting."

Global undernourishment shouldn't exist.  Each day the world farmers produce the equivalent of
2,868 calories per person on the planet.  That's enough to surpass the World Food program's recommended intake of 2,100 daily calories and enough to support our population which is inching toward 9 billion.  Even so, an estimated 24,000 die of hunger each day (thankfully that's down from the estimated 35,000 ten years ago).  Hunger kills more than the combined total of HIV Aids, Malaria, and Diabetes each year.  About 10 % of that total is caused by famines and civil wars but the vast majority come to pass because families facing extreme poverty are simply unable to get enough food to eat.  Incomes and commodity prices establish where food goes.  The quality of roads, rails and
airports determines how it gets there.  Isn't it a blessing that our only concern with calories usually comes when we're trying to lose a few pounds?  I guess that's one of the reasons that charities that satisfy hunger pains are high on my donation list.  I just reviewed my charitable giving for the past four months and find that feeding the hungry takes up 14% of my giving.  Maybe that's powered by the fact that I've always been blessed with a healthy appetite.  Also, when Jesus taught us to pray, we're not to say "Give me today my daily bread."  Instead we're to pray,  "Give US today OUR daily bread". And, I'm hoping the US and OUR include some starving little kid in Somalia.  But the biggest blessing is that God placed all of us in a locale where we don't have to worry about how to satisfy our needs.
Love, Boppa John
