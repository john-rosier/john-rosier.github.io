THE GIFT OF BREATH

Dear Family.  My prayer today comes from Psalm 39:
"Show us, O Lord, the number of days we have on this earth.  The span of our years is as nothing before you; each man's life is but a breath."

Do you know someone who has emphysema or asthma?  When we see someone gasping for each breath, it makes us appreciate the gift of normal breathing that God gives us.  The American Lung Association estimates that more than 158,000 U.S. citizens died of Lung Cancer in 2015.  This represents close to 27% of all cancer deaths, killing more people than any other cancer.  Asthma affects close to 6.3 million children under 18 , and more than half of those have experienced an asthma attack during the previous year.  COPD
(chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is the third leading cause of death in America, just behind heart disease and cancer.  About half the people in the U.S. live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution which can make them a part of the 20% lung cancer patients who are nonsmokers.  Researchers found that there are genetic similarities between women exposed to smoky coal from cooking and heating in rural China and people who smoke cigarettes. Speaking of that, about 40 million adults in the U.S. still smoke...and there are an estimated 480,000 tobacco-related deaths in America each year. including those related to second-hand smoke.
During World War II, those of us in combat  were given cases of free cigarettes.  There never was any mention of cancer at that time, but even if there was, the chances of  catching a shell from a German Panzer were far greater...and I smoked for the first time.  It took me 20 long years to break the habit, and God has spared me for another 60. He surrounded me with a loving family and great friends.  Thanks be to God.
Love, Boppa John
