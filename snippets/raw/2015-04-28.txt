MILK IS GOOD FOR ILK

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 97:
"Lord. we rejoice in you who are righteous and we praise your holy name."

Almost all medical scientists agree that calcium is an essential nutrient for all our cells, and if we don't consume enough, our bones release some of their stored cache to maintain precise levels in the blood.  It's the "enough" that scientists can't agree on.  As with most nutrition debates, moderation is probably our best bet.  Studies have not been able to nail down how much calcium we need.  Karl Michelsson a renown Swedish medic says, "If you have low calcium intake, you will have weak bones and a higher risk of fractures.  But, the tricky thing is, what level of intake is good for you?"  Milk, of course, is a concentrated source of calcium and it also contains protein and other nutrients.  So, to solve my personal preference, I consume one 8-ounce glass on my shredded wheat cereal each day. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, that intake has 300 milligrams of calcium.  That amount, by the way is the equivalent of eating 10 cups of spinach or 4.5 servings of broccoli.  My daily intake might not be correct, but since the medical scientists can't agree on how much is correct, we'll all have to set our own standards.  One thing for sure, Scientists agree that milk contains all the building blocks needed to make new tissue.  This is especially important for all of you baby boomers who will soon make up a huge per cent of my "Old Folks" category.
Love, Boppa John
P.S.  Please don't forget to pray for those poor souls in Nepal.
