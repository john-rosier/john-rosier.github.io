THINKING LIKE A DOLPHIN

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 89:
"Lord, you are our glory and strength, indeed our whole being belongs to you.  Thank you Lord for your faithfulness."

This is a strange thing...I have never enjoyed going to a zoo and have never had any desire to go on an African Safari (even though some of my relatives said this was the best vacation they ever had.)
Yet, I'm always attracted to articles that feature ways that God has blessed the Animal Kingdom in teaching them ways to communicate, hunt, protect themselves, et al.  I read about dolphins who have been trained to perform any of the dozens of maneuvers in their repertoire but not repeat anything they've already done in that session.  Their trainer presses her palms together over her head , the signal to innovate, and then puts her fists together, the sign for "tandem".  With those two gestures, she has instructed the dolphins to show her a behavior she hasn't seen in this session and do it in unison.  The dolphins disappear below the surface, do several seconds of audible chirping, and the surface and perform in perfect tandem.  Researchers have recorded thousands of these dolphin "communications"  to try to eavesdrop and eventually understand the meaning of some of these "chirps".  This study  has been going on for over 50 years to no avail.  One Researcher writes,"Ultimately dolphin vocalization is either one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of science or one of its greatest blind alleys."  Another thing that Researchers have discovered is that each dolphin has a distinct "signature whistle" to identify one another.  No other animal, besides humans, is believed to have specific labels for individuals.  Dolphins live about 50 years and that signature whistle never changes.  Humans and dolphins share one notable piece of anatomy...a large, complicated brain.  And, my large brain tells me you're probably bored by now,  so it's time to quit.
Love, Boppa John
