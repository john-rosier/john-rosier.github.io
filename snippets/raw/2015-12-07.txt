MINING ENERGY FROM THE MOON

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 84:
"O Lord God Almighty, blessed is the man who trusts in you.  Thank you, Lord, for your faithfulness."

Scientists believe that a gas known as helium-3 can produce abundant energy from nuclear fission  without simultaneously creating any radioactive waste.  Yet Helium-3 is rarely ever mentioned in the same breath with the approved trinity of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.  It is true that helium-3 is rarely found on earth.  Our planet's thick atmosphere and magnetic field block out rays from the sun that carry the element.  But, our nearest neighbor, the airless moon, turns out to be saturated with the stuff.  In 1985, lunar soil samples brought back by the Apollo mission contained unexpectedly high concentrations of it.  Scientists speculate that just 40 tons of helium-3 (about enough to fill two railroad boxcars) could power the entire Earth at our present level of energy consumption for a year. It would free our dependence on fossil fuels.  With coal currently accounting for two-thirds of the energy consumed by China, they are fiercely interested in Helium-3.  Their version of our NASA first put a landing and rover on the moon just two years ago. They hope to retrieve lunar soil samples by 2017 and  China's ultimate goal is to establish a helium-3 mining colony on the moon.*      I predict that none of this will happen in your or my lifetime, but it surely will sometime...and it again fulfills the promise to our forefather Abraham that "The Lord will provide."
Love, Boppa John
