LUNCH BREAK WALKS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 29:
"Lord, you give strength to us, your people;  Father, we thank you for you bless us with peace."

This morning, when I checked in at the Fitness Center, they told me that I owed $195 for the coming year.  As I was exercising, I calculated in my size 7 1/2 long oval head, that it cost me only 65 cents per visit.  And, I had never given it much thought in the past, but I must have an addiction for exercise.  During the twenty years that I worked downtown, I'd take a half cheese sandwich and an apple to work each day.  It was exactly one mile to the Wrigley Building from my office and I'd make the hike while consuming my lunch.  On rainy days or the cold winter variety, I'd cut through buildings along  the route.  There was one tunnel from a train station that went for about a block, and often there would be some hospital Agent there giving free blood pressure exams.  One day when I stopped there, my blood pressure was very high.  The Agent asked if I drank a lot of coffee.  I told him that there were large coffee urns just outside my office and that I probably downed a dozen cups a day.  He told me to switch to Decaf, and then stop by for another test in a couple of weeks.  Guess what!  That solution worked and my blood pressure went back to normal.  The last three years of my tenure at Swift, our office moved to the residential segment of Oak Brook...no more buildings or tunnels to cut through.  Daughter Deb came to the rescue by making me a large pair of water-proof
baggy pants to slip over my regular trousers.  When I retired in 1986, Jean, Kim and I used to walk a couple of miles in the Evergreen Plaza Mall before the shoppers arrived.  I leave with a bit of advice...
if you have to be addicted, choose exercise (it surely beats smoking or drinking).
Love,  Boppa John
