33,237 DAYS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 90, the oldest Psalm in the bible, written by Moses:
"Lord, in your Word you have instructed that we number our days aright that we may gain a heart of wisdom.  Thank you,Father, for this promise."

Today is my 91st birthday, hence it is my 33,237th day on Planet Earth.  A good number of these days are still fresh In my memory, and I'll review some of them here.  (This can get pretty boring, so stay close to the delete key).  ### 3/17/24 My 15-year-old brother, Frank, runs a mile to our nearest phone at my Uncle Mart Ozinga's to call my Mother's Doctor.  He arrives and helps my Mom successfully deliver her sixth baby. ###  3/17/31 I remember my 7th birthday when I returned from school where I had proudly deposited seven pennies in our class's Missionary Jar and telling  my Mom that I wanted to be a missionary when I grew up. ###September 1937, A scared 13 year-old, who had spent the last eight years in a 4-room school,  enters Calumet High School with its enrollment of over 5,000 students. ### June 1941, my first day on my job  as a $15 per week messenger at Swift & Company. ### February 1943, leaving a sobbing Mother and a morose Dad as I departed for Camp Grant, my first stop in World War II. ### December 1944 steaming out of a New York harbor past the Statue of Liberty (which I thought I'd never see again).  ### July 1946, A jubilant return to the USA to a port in New Jersey where we were treated to a midnight steak dinner, with all of the trimmings, including real milk. ### Summer of 1947, meeting Jean for the first time at a wiener roast at Cedar Lake, Indiana (I was dating a different gal in Jean's Mazelles Club at the time). ### 2/14/48 Stopping on the way to a Valentine's Day wedding reception and slipping an engagement ring on Jean's finger  #11/5/48 Wedding Bells which tied the happy knot that lasted for 64 years and 10 months. ### Sunday,4/30/50, the birth of our first daughter, Debra. ### 3/17/54 the birth of our second daughter, Kimberly, plus the first day of construction of our new home in Evergreen Park. ### 6/12/70  Jean and Kim attend a very pompous graduation event at Rockefeller Chapel to witness my getting an MBA degree from the University of Chicago. ### Christmas morning 1975, Jean, Kim & I drove to OHare to pick up Deb, Barry and Adam, our first of five wonderful grandkids. ### April 1986, I complete 45 years at Swift and taking Jean's advice, I retire at the age of 62.  ### January 1993, we buy our current home and I begin drawing plans to add a Family Room, Dinette, Bathroom and Laundry room. ### 6/2/09 Grady Kostelyk is born, the first of seven lovable Great Grandkids. ###  9/3/13  After a host of painful ailments, Jean goes to her heavenly home. ### 3/17/15 I celebrate my 91st birthday, thankful to God for a wonderful life.
Love, Boppa John
