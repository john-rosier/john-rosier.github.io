AMAZING CANINES

Dear Family.  My prayer today comes from Psalm 41:
"We continuously pray, Lord, have mercy on us and heal us.  We confess. Lord that our sins against you are many."

It's hard to conceive of a more brilliant tool than a canine's nose for sniffing out danger in public places.  They're known as Explosive Detection Canines (EDC's) but most people call them Bomb Dogs.  Dogs don't need to be taught how to smell, of course, but they do need to be taught where to smell - along the seams of a suitcase, say, or underneath a pallet, where the vapors that are heavier than air settle.  Each dog works with one specific handler, usually for 8 or 9 years.
Strictly speaking, the dog doesn't smell the bomb.  It deconstructs an odor into its components, picking out the culprit chemicals it has been trained to detect.  Using a cooking analogy:  when you or I walk into a kitchen making spaghetti sauce, our nose says, Aha, spaghetti sauce.
A dog's nose doesn't say that.  Instinctively it says tomatoes, garlic, rosemary, onion, oregano.  It's the handler who says spaghetti sauce or in this case, bomb.  It's hard to imagine a more high-hearted warrior than a dog.  The canines work for love, they work for praise, they work for food, but mostly hey work for the fun of it.  It's all just a big game to them.  Thirty-five per cent of a dog's brain is assigned to smell-related operations.  We humans might smell a teaspoon of sugar in a cup of coffee, a dog could detect a teaspoon in a million gallons of water
(nearly enough to fill two Olympic size swimming pools).  I'm always super-amazed when I discover the intricate details our Creator poured into his making many members of the animal kingdom.
Love, Boppa John
