A 2,000 YEAR-OLD PRESCRIPTION

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 3:
"Thank you, Lord, for your goodness and your mercy.  We confess that we are unworthy sinners and do not deserve the goodness you shower upon us each day."

Most of us have heard about the Hippocratic Oath.  But it is still amazing that the prescriptions  for good health are also attributed to Hippocrates, a visionary Greek physician, that have stood the test of time (about 2,000 years).  Hippocrates prescribed WALKING as Man's best medicine.  His were the first clinical studies by observing people and comparing their health habits. Those who walked more stayed well longer so he often prescribed exercise. A recent national study on more than 650,000 people found that those who walked briskly for just 150 minutes a week gained an average of 3.4 years of life expectancy.  Hippocrates also advised fellow doctors to "Know what person the disease has rather than what disease the person has."  Recent studies have proven that this advice is so true...Dr. Katz, who treats obese patients for weight-loss results, says, "Patients who have stressful jobs, toxic relationships, or poor sleep are unable to lose weight until they fix these issues."  Hippocrates also had success by treating many patients
with a change in their eating habits by insisting they switch to fresh, plant-based diets.  Another of his cautionary prescriptions was to tackle all remedies in moderation.  Exercise, water, and sleep can all be damaging if we overdo them.  I'm just amazed at the work of Hippocrates those thousands of years before MRI's, X-rays, Antibiotics, et al.  And, every time I read of some poor mother in a third-world country carrying a sick child for miles to a makeshift clinic only to find that their medical supplies have run out,  I give thanks to God for placing me in the U.S. where I have all the advantages of modern medicine.
Love, Boppa John
