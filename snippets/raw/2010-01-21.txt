Scott Brown

Hi!  Let's hear it for the CHRISTIAN REFORMED CHURCH!  After 220 years,
we finally have a United States Senator...the internet says of the
recent replacement for Ted Kennedy's seat:  "Scott Brown and his
family worship at New England Chapel in Franklin, a member of the
Christian Reformed Church of North America.  The Brown
family has also raised over $5.000.000 for the Nuns at Mount St. Mary's
Abbey helping to install solar panels, a wind turbine and a candy mfg.
plant run by the Order."  I note that Bryan Weigers is  the pastor  at
Frannklin CRC.    Thought this would be of interest to you.  JR
