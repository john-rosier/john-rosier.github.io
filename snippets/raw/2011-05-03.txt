Letter "X"

Hi Grandkids,  Here's my prayer for today ....  Lord, when I think of 
the letter X, I'm reminded to give thanks that you placed me in a 
country where I have the freedom to cast a ballot.  Guide my hand, 
Lord, to choose candidates and referendums that will build your kingdom.
SNIPPET  Xercise.  I'm really a lousy dieter, but for most of my 
life, I've been a devotee of exercise.  During the twenty years that 
Swift's office was located downtown, I'd pack an apple and a half 
cheese sandwich each day.  I'd consume them on a two-mile roundtrip 
hike to the Wrigley Building.  On the cold, blustery winter days I'd 
cut through many buildings to escape the winds.  I remember one day 
in particular when the wind-chill factor was minus 15o Fahrenheit.
I usually took my transistor radio along for entertainment.  When our 
office moved to Oakbrook in 1982, Deb made me
a pair of large waterproof pants to slip over my regular trousers on 
snowy or rainy days.  The first years after I retired
Donno, Kim and I would walk in the Evergreen Plaza before the stores 
opened for business.  There are still a lot of these shopping mall 
walkers each day.  For the past ten years, I've gone to a health club 
for about an hour workout four mornings each week.  For me, it's a 
lot easier routine than always being hungry on a diet.  Anyhow, the 
older one gets, the more important it is to stick to some kind of an 
exercise program to slow down the aging process.
Love,  Boppa
