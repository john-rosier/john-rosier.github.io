LET THERE BE LIGHT

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 91:
"Lord, you have promised in your word that when we call upon you, you will answer us.  You will be with us in trouble, you will deliver us and honor us with long life and show us your salvation ."

When we toured Europe in 1978, we saw many magnificent cathedrals.  What really stands out though, is the work of Sir Christopher Wren.  He designed and built over 50 church buildings in London in the late 1600's.  Unlike the popular stained glass windows of that era, Wren was convinced that all of his designs had to use clear glass window panes.  As he wrote,  "God's greatest gift to man is light."  Allowing light to bathe people as they worshipped was, to Wren, a celebration of that gift.  In Genesis  we read that God created light on the first day of creation, His first real gift to man.
We're not sure what that first light is exactly since the sun and the stars were created on the fourth day,  In the rest of scripture "light" and "darkness" are metaphors for good and evil.  Jesus said, "I am the light of the world."  So, in my  way of thinking, Wren was right.  Our greatest gift is that our sins are forgiven through Jesus' sacrifice for us on the cross.        Love, BOPPA  JOHN
