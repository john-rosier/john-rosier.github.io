Letter "B"

Hi Grandkids,  Here I am again......you'll have to put up with these 
missals once a week:
PRAYER "B":  Lord, I give thanks for your Beautiful creation.  The 
beauty of sunrises and sunsets, bright-colored flowers, spectacular, 
snow covered mountain peaks, swift-flowing rivers, lush forests, and 
all that you have created.
SNIPPET B:  I celebrated my 5th Birthday on March 17, 1929, and five 
months later I was enrolled in the Evergreen Park Christian School. 
1929 was the year our Economy crashed and the $3.00 per month tuition 
was a burden for most families.  I can remember my Dad, who was a 
School Board member during the Great Depression saying that at some 
Board meetings, the Treasurer would ask each attendee to kick in one 
dollar to buy coal (at $2 per ton) so they could continue to heat the 
school in the winter.  A birthday present would usually be some 
article of clothing since toys were a luxury.  At Christmas, however, 
we were allowed to pick any $1.00 item from the Sears catalogue.....
(after Christmas the catalogue took its place next to our outhouse 
hole;  Charmin came into existence years later).  For about 3 or 4 
Christmases in a row, I picked Gilbert's Beginners Erector Set.  Each 
$1 set on ensuing Christmases would give me an additional supply of 
the metal girders, nuts and screws, etc. to increase my capability of 
building larger projects.  Also, on each Birthday we were given a penny
for each year to deposit in our School's missionary bank.  For some 
reason, I can clearly remember coming home and  telling my Mother on 
my seventh birthday that I was going to become a Missionary when I 
grew up.  Actually, I spent my 19th, 20th, and 21st birthdays in the 
Military.  God has spared me for many more........for which I am 
EXTREMELY THANKFUL!!
Love, Boppa
