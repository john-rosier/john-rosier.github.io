THE END OF A LONG BOARDWALK

HI!  Today was sort of a milestone in my life.  I have served on the Board of Directors of Bibles for Missions for 19 years and today we had our last meeting.  On 1/1/16 our operation is being taken over by The Bridge Teenage Center.  As I was driving home from this final Board Meeting, I began reminiscing on the various other Boards I've been on, such as Bible League International, Trinity College, Church Elder, Roseland and Southwest Christian Schools.  And, today's meeting brought an end to that chapter of my life.  When I calculated the number of board years, it totals 69.  After my workout I stopped at the Palos Library to check out a book, and guess what, they were celebrating Veterans' Day by serving a lunch (who says "There's no such thing as a free lunch"?)  At any rate, it was a great day and I keep thanking God for all these extra days he gives me.  Love, Boppa John
