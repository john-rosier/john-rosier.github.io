THE AGING PROCESS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 90:
"Our Father God, teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom."

Last week, Stella Kostelyk celebrated her 103rd birthday.  (she is the namesake and great grandmother of my great granddaughter, 5-year-old Stella).  When people ask her, "What's your secret in living so long?"  Her standard answer is, "I just don't die."  There are more than 72,000 centenarians in the U.S. today, a 44 percent increase since the year 2,000.  There have been many studies conducted with this aging segment, and here are some of the findings:  1) The 65-plus subjects who felt three or more years younger than their real age were less likely to die over an eight-year period than were people who felt their age or older.  2)  People who consumed the most veggies and fruit had a 46 percent lower chance of dying over a five-year period compared with those who ate them infrequently.  3)  Near centenarians share a number of personality traits, including optimism and joyfulness. Being adaptable and flexible helps people avoid stress and anxiety which can increase longevity.  4)  Older adults with the highest blood levels of omega 3 fatty acids (eating a lot of fish) lived an average of two more years than with those with lower levels.  5) Harvard researchers studied more than 23,000 people for six years and found that those who regularly took a 30-minute siesta had a 37 percent lower chance of dying from heart disease than did those who stayed awake all day.  6)  People who exercised and in midlife were less likely to develop Alzheimer's, certain cancers, heart disease and type 2 diabetes in their 70's and beyond. 7) Feeling connected to family and friends keeps people engaged and facilitates healthy aging.  So, there you have it.  I still think that getting old is not for sissies, but it can be rewarding until such time as we go to our heavenly home.
Love, Boppa John
