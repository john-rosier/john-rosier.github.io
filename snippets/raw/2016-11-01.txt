1/40th CENT PER POINT

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 120;
"Lord, you will not let our feet slip, for you watch over us day and night.  Thank you, Lord."

I don't know how many ships the Kaiser Company built during World War II,  but at their peak. they were turning out an average of a completed ship per day.  They were called Liberty Ships and I do remember that it was a 13-day voyage for one of these troop-carrying ships between New York and England.  In July of 1946, I boarded one of these Liberty Ships for my happy trip home to the U.S.A.  Since we had nothing to do except sleep and eat three meals daily , I joined three other Officers in a game of contract bridge each day.  I can't recall how and when I learned to play Bridge, but to this day I always read the daily "Bridge Column" in my morning paper.  One changes partners in a game, but at the end of each game, you record the points won or lost and accumulate this score for each individual player.  We decided to play for 1/40th cent per point, and after 13 days, the winner earned somewhere in the $3.00 to $4.00 range.  Not so with the enlisted men on our ship.  They played either "craps" with dice or poker.  I can remember at the end of each day, a few of these guys would go to the ship's Purser and have him lock up several thousand dollars.  Speaking of poker, my Battalion Commander, Colonel Miles Standish, (whose ancestors came to settle in New York ages ago) loved to play poker and often did so with a couple of other Officers each night by candlelight.  Unfortunately, he never got to take any of his winnings home, since he was killed by an incoming German 88 mm artillery shell. So, that's how  we spent some of our combat and peacetime days in WW II,  and I continue to thank God for sparing me all of these happy years.
Love, Boppa John
