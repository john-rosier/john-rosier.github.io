Prayers & Snippets

Dear Family,,  So, Here's the deal: last year at this time I was emailing my Nephews, Nieces and Cousins and giving them a status report on Aunt Dorothy (in the hospital and later at Manor Care).  After Dorothy died on 3/9/12, Deb suggested that since I had this group of email addresses plus the 50 Prayers and Snippets I had sent to the Grandkids, why not just recycle that info and email it to the Nephews and Nieces and my last three cousins in Denver.  I've done that over the past year and now I've only one more old snippet left to send next week.  BUT, said Deb, I should continue to recall more "HAPPENINGS" and make up some new snippets to send to the Grandkids and Nephews and Nieces (She claims that it would be a good anti-aging workout for my brain).  I have plenty of "Psalm Prayers" left, so I'm going to start sending sporadic snippets W/B 3/4/13.  When they are boring or repetitive (as most of our generation's stories are, just hit the delete button).  Love, Boppa John
