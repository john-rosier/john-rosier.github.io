The ABC's of Prayer (plus snippets)

All Grandkids,  Somewhere in the Bible it says, "Pray without 
ceasing."  Although prayer is a wonderful perk that God gives all 
Christians, we usually get pretty repetitious in our "utterings". 
Sometime ago  I wrote out 26 prayers on index cards that followed our 
alphabet.  I was looking at these cards at Silver Lake last summer 
and I thought it might be a good idea to share them with you 
Grandkids.  At the same time, I could alphabetize snippets from my 86-
plus years.  Most of these will be boring, but that's why every 
computer has a DELETE key.......so here goes:
LETTER A:  Lord, I pray for those who are suffering from Arthritis, 
A.L.S., Alzheimer's, AID's, and cancer.  I pray that you will help 
our Medical Community find a cure for these diseases.
SNIPPET A:  Athleticism, I've always admired the coordination of the 
Jocks who could excel at most sports.  I was just the opposite.  On 
church or school teams I usually played right field, where about two 
or less balls would be hit during the entire game.  I bowled in our 
Church League for about twenty years and my average was 136 each year 
(although I did roll a lucky 256 game one night).  I've golfed for 
about sixty years and it would be a rare happening to break
100 (although once I had a lucky hole-in-one).  My tennis game was 
awful.  I guess I've just lived in this uncoordinated, non-athletic 
state all my life.
Love,  Boppa
