POLITICS

Hi!  I never try to push my political stance on others, but, since our next President will undoubtedly be my last, I'm making an exception and quoting todays editorial from the Chicago Sun Times...
  Quote:  "Trump is not strong; he's frighteningly weak.  He arguably suffers from narcissistic personality disorder - meaning his wobbly
self-esteem needs constant, mantra like invocations of his own fabulousness and endless affirmations from others.  He goes ballistic
when suffering even the smallest slight.  He's an ignoramus.  Ads should remind voters, for example, that he doesn't know what the nuclear triad is.  His whole foreign policy experience is being on a TV show with Vladimir Putin, who he praises because his pathetic need for approval utterly distorts his judgement.  Putin said something nice about Trump, and Trump praised him in return.  What's a few murders between amigos?  He is completely immoral, recommending torture and the killing of wives and children of suspected terrorists.  Trump is a Clinton-class liar. Split screens ought to clarify that.  He didn't oppose the Iraq War.  He was for it.  He's not self-funding his campaign.  He's collected millions in contributions.  He evaded the draft and then offered that sleeping around and risking STDs his "personal Vietnam".  He's beyond vulgar. He complained publicly about his first wife's breast implants.  Nearly nude pictures of wife #3 are everywhere.  Unlike, say, Mitt Romney, who Democrats effectively caricatured as a cruel business tycoon, Trump really is one.  He has a history of paying off elected officials to get special treatment, stiffing business associates and abusing those who work for him.  He's not a self-made man who "built a great company."  He inherited millions from his Dad.  He ran four businesses into bankruptcy.
(there's plenty more, but this article ends with:  "This con man must be unmasked")
