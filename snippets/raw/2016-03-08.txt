HIGH COST OF PRISONS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 114:
"Glorify your name, not ours, O Lord.  Cause everyone to praise your lovingkindness and your truth."

The other day, I read an article about the high costs of incarcerating prisoners.  To make matters worse, the U.S.A. has the largest prison population of all developed nations...an estimated 2.4 million. Our Cook County jail averages 9,000 prisoners and is the largest single site prison in the U.S.  On average, 53% of their inmates are black, 36% Hispanic, and 11% white and other.  Our Lawmakers seem to keep finding things that are worthy of incarceration.  As an example,
Chicago's Mayor is trying to get a law passed which would make selling "loosies" a crime earning up to six months in prison.  Loosies are cigarettes which street vendors sell at two for a dollar.  Chicago has the highest cigarette tax in the Nation at $7.70 per pack (that's 38 cents per cigarette).  Vendors buy cartons of Newport Cigarettes in neighboring Hammond, Indiana where the tax is much less, and can make a reasonable profit selling Loosies at two for $1.00.  A street vendor can sell peanuts, newspapers. et al on the street. Granted cigarettes cause a health problem but they are still as legal as peanuts.  Getting back to the high cost to taxpayers for incarceration, the cost in Cook County Jail comes to $64 per day, per prisoner.  One Alderman wrote, "To now criminalize the sale of selling loose cigarettes is ludicrous.  This is a problem we caused  with our highest in the Nation taxes, and now we want to solve it by putting generally poor, young African American and Latin American men in jail."  Why don't we just confine violent offenders and put non-violents on house arrest wearing a GPS bracelet?  It seems like sometimes solving a problem leads to bigger problems, doesn't it?
Love,  Boppa John
