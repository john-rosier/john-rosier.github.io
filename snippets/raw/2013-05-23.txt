MEMORIAL DAY

HI!  I'm just sneaking this extra in because of what I read in the Chicago Sun Times:
QUESTION:  What do Ted Kacynski, John Rosier,  and Richard Driehaus have in common?
ANSWER:  All three spent their boyhoods in Evergreen Park.
QUESTION:  How will they spend Memorial Day?
ANSWER:  Kacynski (the Unabomber) will continue rotting in a Colorado prison after killing three and injuring 21 with his parcel post bombs.
Rosier will give thanks for still being around to celebrate his 89th Memorial Day and will probably go out to dinner with his spouse and some friends.
Driehaus (Anna Wolff's boss) will continue to spend part of his fortune to help others.  As the Sun Times writer reveals
"Kudos to financial guru Richard Driehaus for underwriting $100 gift cards for the Illinois Gold Star Families, kin of slain Chicago Police officers, who will be attending the city's annual Memorial Day weekend commemorations."
Love, BOPPA JOHN
