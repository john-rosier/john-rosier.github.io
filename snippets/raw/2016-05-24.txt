DINOSAUR AGE SURVIVORS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 59:
"I sing praises to you, O God, for you are my Strength, my Fortress, and my Loving God."

Every time Archeologists dig up the bones of a dinosaur in South Dakota or somewhere, I pause and try to imagine what our world was like back in those days.  Scientists speculate that the dinosaurs were wiped out when an asteroid about 6 miles in diameter struck our planet earth in the vicinity of the Yucatan Peninsula.  One of the survivors of that age was the Echidna.  This hedgehog-like mammal has bristling spikes and a long snout and makes its habitat in Australia and part of New Guinea.  These oddball primitive animals lay eggs and cope with tough conditions by becoming inert and chilly, a state known as torpor. This behavior is  the marvel of how these weird animals survive and withstand fires.  Recently, a team of scientists tracked the fate of Echidnas in a nature preserve set ablaze to aid fire-dependent vegetation.  The fire burned for days, but the Echidnas kept their cool.  In the hours after the fire began, the animals stayed put rather than venturing abroad (according to GPS trackers the Scientists had implanted in the animals).  Other sensors showed that in the weeks after the blaze, most of the Echidnas slipped again and again into a torpid state lasting up to four days.  Echidnas probably warded off  their fiery  death by holing up in thick trees and logs, the scientists say.  And by going torpid after the fire , the animals cut their need for energy...a smart idea when the forest was smoldering and food was scarce.  Isn't it amazing how God watches over his creation?  Like the lyrics of that old hymn, "His eye is on the sparrow, and I know he watches me."
