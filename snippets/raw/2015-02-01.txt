CREATOR INPUT

Dear Family,  Last night I received a call informing me that our church service for this morning was cancelled due to the forecast of a 10" to 12" snowfall.  As I climbed out of bed at 7:00 AM, I thought my routine of  reading two newspapers with breakfast would surely be gone (because both papers would be buried under the snow).  When I looked out at the driveway, I could see a couple of protruding lumps of snow that might be my papers.  I rolled up the pant legs of my jeans, went out, and sure enough I retrieved my papers.  Taped on my refrigerator, I have this message:
"GOOD MORNING!  This is God.  I'll be handling all your problems today. I won't need your help.
Have a good day."  I know that retrieving my newspapers is a trivial thing, but God solves so many of
my daily problems, that I want to pass this along to you, while the snow continues to build up.
Love, Boppa John
