Letter "S"

Hi Grandkids,  Here's my prayer for today  ....  Lord, I thank you 
for the supreme element in Salvation, which is grace.
As the Apostle Paul wrote,  "It is by grace we are saved, through 
faith, and this, not from ourselves, it is the gift of God."
SNIPPET "S":  Snowed in.  The Chicago winters can get pretty harsh, 
and I've been snowed in twice.  The first time was in January 1967 
when we had 27 inches of snow dumped on us in 24 hours.  I had driven 
in that Thursday as I had a class that night at the U. of Chgo. 
After class, I called home and Donno said not to try getting through 
since the Dan Ryan was like a parking lot.  So I bought some socks, 
toothbrush, shaving stuff and slept in a bachelor's pad of a guy in 
my department (accessible by subway).  The next day, the Rock Island 
put on a two-car  commuter train at about 2:00 PM and I crowded in to 
get within the two-mile walk home from 95th Street.  There was 
another short train downtown on Saturday so I could retrieve my 
car.  The other time i got snowed in was more enjoyable.  Bob and 
Tootie Drenth were married on 11/15/47 and Donno and I got hitched on 
11/5/48.  So every November we celebrated together by taking the 
girls to a restaurant they had never eaten in before plus a play. 
One year we planned a real surprise. a weekend at the Wagon Wheel 
Resort in Rockton, Illinois.  This required a lot more planning.  I 
made a list of all of Donno's makeup and went shopping at Fields.  I 
was shocked at how expensive that stuff is!  But when I explained to 
the helpful clerk what I was doing, she sold me a bunch of small 
bottles.  So I packed a suitcase for both of us and we really 
surprised the girls.  Donno was flabbergasted when we took the 
suitcases out of the trunk.  And, an added surprise.  It snowed so 
hard of Sunday that the roads were impassible and we had to stay over 
until Monday!
  Love,  Boppa
