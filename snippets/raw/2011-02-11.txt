Letter "M"

Hi Grandkids,  This is my prayer for today ........ I praise you 
Lord, for you are Merciful.  I thank you for showing mercy and 
forgiveness to sinners like me.
SNIPPET "M":  Marconi comes to the farm ... About a decade or two 
before I was born, an Italian named Marconi invented the wireless 
receiver (radio).  At about the age of 11 or 12, I built my first 
"crystal set".  This as a crude radio that had no batteries or 
electrical input, but depended on a small crystal, an aerial, a 
ground wire, and some huge earphones to get broadcast recetion. 
Since I hated the boring job of weeding, after a time I tried to make 
my crystal set mobile.  I fastened some old straps to a small box and 
strung about 30 feet of aerial wire through holes in a "cross-
like" set of slats mounted to the box.  For the radio ground, I 
hooked up an old piece of heavy chain to drag behind my back-mounted 
radio .  Guess what!  The reception was pretty poor because of static 
(and sometimes I could only get agricultural reports) but it did 
relieve the monotony.  I considered it a smashing success on the days 
I'd pick up some country/western music like Lulabelle & Scotty.   
Love, Boppa
P.S.  Last week Tuesday we left Midway at 11:00 AM bound for sunny 
Florida.  Because of the Chicago blizzard, the airport was shut down 
one hour after we departed.  Walt picked us up this afternoon and he 
said the balmy  20° was the warmest here since we had left on Feb 1 
WOW!
