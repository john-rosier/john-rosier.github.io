A MIRACLE TREATMENT FOR STROKE

Dear Family,  My Prayer today comes from Psalm 89:
"Lord, you give strength to us, your people; Father, we thank you for you bless us with peace."

There are few medical conditions that strike faster and with more finality than the brain death caused by stroke.  Normally, large vessel strokes
(big clots in large arteries that jeopardize blood flow to huge brain territories) are deadly.  Existing blood-thinning medications aren't effective in dissolving large clots.  But a new procedure has had such success that hospitals around the country are changing their protocols. Five recent major clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy, in which a catheter is headed through an artery in the groin and up to the blockage in the brain, where a stent pulls the blockage from the vessel.  The chance of a full recovery from a large-vessel stroke goes down each minute it's left untreated.  But, with mechanical thrombectomy that number soars to above 60 percent if treatment is started within six hours.  PatIents go from literally dying to going home to their families.  It's about as miraculous a thing as you can encounter in medicine. 
Love, Boppa John
