Letter "G"

Hi Grandkids,  Here's my prayer for today:  Lord, may I ever express 
my gratitude for the Grace you have given me.  I marvel and am 
forever grateful that you would send your only begotten son to die on 
the cross for my sins.
SNIPPET G:  Goodness and mercy.  I've probably told most of you of 
this experience before, but it is etched in my life-long memory 
bank.  When I was 11 years old and in seventh grade, one of my 
classmates died at the Little Company of Mary Hospital.  Little Al 
Fischer had a blood disease, said our Teacher, and was getting weaker 
with each passing day.  Our Class had memorized the 23rd Psalm, and 
Al had recited that Psalm several times on the night he died. Our 
Teacher told us that the Nuns and Nurses were really touched by 
this.  She said that "goodness and mercy" had followed Al all the 
days of his young life and now he was "dwelling in the house of the 
Lord forever."  Back in 1935 only dignitaries were "waked" in a 
funeral parlor or a church.  Ordinary folks were laid out in the 
living room of their homes.  Our class was led in single file past 
little Al's casket it made quite an impression since this was the 
first cadaver most of us had ever seen.  I know in my case it brought 
the 23rd Psalm into the 20th Century and I've leaned heavily on God's 
"goodness and mercy" all the days of my life.  Donno and I pray that 
each of you will do likewise.    Love,  Boppa
