3+ YEARS OF VACATION

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 61:
"Increase our days, O Lord, may we be enthroned in your presence forever; appoint your love and faithfulness to
protect us."
When I started my employment at Swift & Company in June of 1941, I was impressed by their vacation policy.  It was 2 weeks annually for the first 5 years:  3 weeks from 6 to 10 years;  4 weeks from 11 to 15 years;  and 5 weeks from 16 years until termination.  Some folks might not think of that perk as being important, but I have always worked hard and vacationed easily.  Anyhow,  when I retired in 1986, I looked back and added up over three years of great vacation time.  The only vacation that we didn't go some place was 1955 ... that's when I was having our first house built in Evergreen Park and had to do a lot of the work (i.e. nailing on the roof, painting, staining, etc).  One year, the C.E.O. of our division of about 30 employees, announced that there had been 73 weeks of vacation time given up that year,
and he wanted to thank all of those loyal (I call them poor saps) employees.  Guess what, I outlasted every one of those guys, including the C.E.O.  When I had to give a pep talk to some new hires, I'd advise them not to give up one hour of their vacation.  I know that our passing to the Great Beyond is only measured in God's time, but I do thank Him that by his grace, I'm beginning my 27th year of retirement (vacation).  I also know that God created some individuals who enjoy work more than vacation, and that's OK, but some of them miss a great deal of family fun.  The most important thing is that God placed us in the good old U.S.A. instead of some Third World Country.
Love,  Boppa John
