BUREAUCRACY BURIED IN THE PAST

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 52:
" Lord, I trust in your unfailing love forever and ever; for what you have done I will always praise you in the presence of your faithful people."

When Swift & Company promoted me from the Messenger Department in 1941 to become a junior clerk for the Controller's Office, I often had to walk about a block from our office to a warehouse and retrieve a file that one of my superiors needed.  This was a dusty old place that contained boxes and boxes of old files sorted by date and enclosed in manilla folders.  Years later when computers came on the scene everything was digitalized and  there wasn't a need for a special storage place for old files.  I guess that's why I was shocked to read recently of how pension processing of retired Federal Employes is handled.  Every day trucks full of paperwork turn off a country road north of Pittsburgh and descend into the caverns of an old limestone mine.  About 230 feet below the surface, there are over 600 employees of the Office of Personnel Management working from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Monday through Friday.  The old mine's tunnels have room for more than 28,000 file cabinets of paper records.  This time-wasting system is an example of how hard it is to change a big bureaucratic system.  Over the past 30 years, administrations have spent more than $100 million trying to automate the system and make it run at the speed of computers.
They couldn't.  The process takes, on average, at least 61 days.  In Texas, where State Retiree's info is digitalized, their process takes two days.  Our latest Great Grandchild was born on 4/14/14,  It would be interesting if, fifty years from now, James Francis Bandstra could google his smart phone and determine
how many truckloads of paper are still descending down that gateway to the abandoned mine.  Love, Boppa John
