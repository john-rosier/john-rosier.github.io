NO. 3 CAUSE OF U.S. DEATHS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 93:
"Lord, your statues stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days."

Top ranked causes of death inform our country's research funding and public health priorities.  The U.S. center's for Disease Control and Prevention lists Heart Disease as number one with 613,000 people dying from that cause in 2013.  Cancer was a strong number two with nearly 585,000 deaths...followed by number three Chronic Respiratory Disease with about 150,000 deaths.  However, "Incidence rates for deaths directly attributed to medical care gone awry haven't been recognized in any standardized method for collecting national statistics," said Dr. Martin Makary, a professor of surgery at John Hopkins University.  The CDC's data collection method does not classify medical errors separately on a death certificate, according to study authors, who called for changes in that criteria.  The Hopkins researchers examined four studies that analyzed medical death rate data from 2000 to 2008, including two that used data from federal agencies.  Then, using hospital admission rates from 2013, the investigators extrapolated that information and, based on a total of over 35 million hospitalizations, concluded that more than 251,000 deaths stemmed from a medical error. That translates to 9.5 percent of the U.S. deaths each year. the new number three cause of U.S. deaths.  I don't know about you, but from now on, I'm getting a second medical opinion.
Love, Boppa John
