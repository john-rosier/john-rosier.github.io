FINANCES...YESTER YEAR AND TODAY

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 14:
"Lord, we confess that most of the time we don't understand your plan for our lives.  We confess that often we turn aside and do not seek you."

I was shocked when I read the estimated cost to raise a child born in 2014 through the age of 18 is over $245,000.  Two of my great grandchildren (James Francis Bandstra and Casey James Kostelyk) fall into that 2014 birth category and I thought, Wow! that's a quarter of a million dollars each.  After I divided that sum by 18, however, and realized we're talking about an annual expenditure of $13,600,
it seems to be a pretty accurate estimate.  Aunt Jean was a lifetime "stay-at-home" Mom, and I made a
modest salary at Swift, but we seemed to make out pretty well.  We were able to pay school tuition, our church budget, and eat well.  Even the college tuition (as I recall, Trinity and Calvin charged about $4,000 a year...which amounts to $22,800 today based on the inflation from 1972's dollar to 2014).
So I guess it's difficult for my generation to grasp today's finances.  As an example, one of this week's Wall Street Journals had an article on the "Rise of the Five-Figure Bike" and featured bikes that sold at $11,549.99.  I bought my first bike in 1937 for the sum of $12.  At the dollars inflation since 1937, that figure would equal $198.00 and my guess is that one could get a pretty decent bike for that amount. This is getting boring, but I just want to tell one more tale.  In 1954 we bought a 55-foot lot at 9744 South Turner in Evergreen Park for $1,750.  Then we built a home on that lot at a cost of $14,500.  We took out a 20-year 7% loan for  $14,500 and the Savings and Loan outfit accepted our purchase of the lot as the loan's down payment.  Our monthly payment was $100 and that sum included our Principle, Interest, Insurance and Property Taxes.  At today's buying power, our $16,250 home would be valued at $143,980.  I hope many of you live to a ripe old age and can look back on 2014 and see how inexpensive things were in the "good old days."    One thing stands out.  No matter where God places us in this continuum of generations, he blesses us with the ability to cope.
Love,  Boppa John
