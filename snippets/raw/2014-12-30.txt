RECYCLING

Dear Family,  My prayer today is from Psalm 1:
"Lord, help us to witness to unbelievers that through your word and plan of salvation they will turn to you and be saved by the grace that you so freely give."

I imagine in the days after Christmas our recycling pickups are astronomical.  According to National Geographic, about 55% of trash generated by Americans ends up in landfills.  About 1/3rd gets recycled and about 12% gets incinerated.  The Swedes have a different solution...they actually import trash.  That's because Sweden incinerates a large percentage of its trash and in so doing they capture a huge amount of energy.  Many parts of Sweden use something called "district heating."  This is a centralized system in which garbage is burned to heat water, and that heated water is piped to residential  and commercial buildings to provide heat.  By burning garbage, Sweden is able to produce 20% of its district heating needs, as well as electricity to about 250,000 homes.  Only about 4% of Swedish refuse finds its way to landfills.  The Swedes are so good at turning trash into energy that they actually have a shortage of  garbage and have to import it from other countries.  Of course there's a lot of garbage available, and the good thing is, the other counties are paying Sweden to take it off their hands.  Many other Nations, especially those in Northern Europe, are investing in similar processes and systems.  The New York Times reported that Oslo, Norway's capital, is now able to heat  "roughly half the city and most of its schools" by burning garbage.  Like Sweden, Oslo has now become a net importer of garbage.  Some cities in the U.S.. such as Ft. Meyers, FL and Dickerson, MD, also have these "Waste to Energy" plants.  According to Wikipedia, European plants outnumber ours by about 4 to 1.  I can't visualize that some day the U.S. will be an importer of garbage.
Have a Happy and Blessed New Year!
Love, Boppa John
