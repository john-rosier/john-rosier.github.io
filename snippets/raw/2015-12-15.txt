MOTHER ROBOT KNOWS BEST

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 148:
"Lord, let the highest heavens and the waters above the heavens praise your name.  May the sun, moon, and all shining stars praise your name."

Scientists at the University of Cambridge have built a "Mother Robot" that independently builds its own   
"Children".  To accomplish this, the mother robot creates a design using between one and five plastic cubes that are stuck together using glue.  Each cube has a small motor inside so that when they are attached to each other in slightly varying formations  it produces a different rate of locomotion when the motors are activated.  Each robot child is tested on how far it moves from the starting position in a certain period of time.  Now, here's where the ingenuity of this project comes into play.  The electronic equipment inside the mother robot evaluates that child's performance to ensure that the preferential traits are passed down to the next iteration, while letting weaknesses fall by the wayside.  She then uses this data to help build the next generation of robots.  One of the recent experiments published in the scientific journal PLOS showed how the mother robot improved the performance of the children robots over ten generations.  The mind-boggeling factor, in my aging brain. is that there is no human intervention beyond simple computer command to build a child robot capable of locomotion.  Who knows what
the future benefits of this technique will produce?  As an example, in the production of automobiles, if you could have cameras evaluating how each car is being created, and from the mistakes you had in the operation you could just re-do for the next car and for the next car, and you keep re-doing it...at the end you're going to have amazing cars.  Everyone knows that a robot can't THINK.  But a robot can be filled with a large bunch of data and then be programmed to SELECT.
