APRIL TAX TIME

Dear Family:  My prayer today comes from Psalm 30...
"Lord, we praise your holy name; for your anger lasts for a moment, but your favor lasts for a lifetime."

All of the news reminders that April 15 is the deadline for Income Tax submissions reminded me of an incident that occurred about 65 years ago.  Jean and I were married in November of 1948.  Jean's Dad had died at the age of 51 (I never met him).  At that time Jean was earning $60 per week as an executive secretary at International Harvester.  For the first 10 months of 1948 she gave her Mother $50 weekly and kept $10 for streetcar fare and snacks.  So, when we filled out our "married filing jointly", tax form we claimed Jean's Mom as a  dependent.  Because of the different surnames, Jean was summoned to go downtown and appear before a Federal Tax Auditor.  Jean was very apprehensive, but when she explained the details to the Auditor, he accepted the status of her mother as a dependent for 1948.  What a relief.  The other day I read an article by the President of National Treasury Department employees' union.  He wrote that over $300 billion in federal taxes go unpaid. Over 80% of this is due to the underreporting of income.  What a difference from 1948 when the IRS was concerned about a $50 weekly payout to a widow.  And, today's tax code is preposterous!  Since 2001 Congress has made about 5,000 changes to the U.S. tax laws.  The Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee wrote, "Today's Tax Code has ten times more words than the Bible with none of the good news".  To that we say Amen and it's high time our Legislators pass some reform rules.  In the meantime, we'll keep paying more and more taxes and at the same time we wouldn't  trade places with those living in any other place.       Love, BOPPA JOHN
