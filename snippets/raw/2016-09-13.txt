IT'S ABOUT TIME!

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 82:
"Lord, we praise your name for you preside in the great assembly; you give judgement to all people on the earth."

I started working for Swift & Company 75 years ago as a $15.00 per week messenger.  It was in a five-story office building in the Stock Yards where smoking was prohibited...but there were hundreds of shiny spittoons near the desks of employees who constantly chewed tobacco.  What a messy job for the cleaning ladies who had to empty and shine up the spittoons each evening!
Since many young people idolize Major League players, there has been a lot of pressure on League management to ban smokeless, chewing tobacco at ballparks.  Because there didn't seem to be any chance of movement in this issue, the Chicago Council passed an ordinance about six weeks ago which bans the use of smokeless tobacco in both the Cubs and Sox ballparks.  Although Cubs manager, Joe Maddon, quit chewing tobacco 15 years ago, he feels that the decision should be up to the player and not an ordinance.  Actually, the Cub's ace pitcher and a real fitness nut, Jake Arrieta, still chews.  At least 28 chemicals in smokeless tobacco have been found to produce cancer.  It can cause oral cancer, esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer.  All tobacco (including smokeless) contains nicotine, which is very addictive.  Actually, nicotine in smokeless tobacco is absorbed through the mouth directly in to the blood.  From there it goes to the brain.  Some cigarette smokers think that switching to smokeless will help them give up cigarettes, although this just compounds the problem.  I quit smoking cigarettes fifty years ago, but I can still remember how addictive nicotine can be.
Love, Boppa John
