CONEY ISLAND vs. THE AMA

Dear Family:
My prayer today comes from Psalm 139:
"We praise you Lord, because we are fearfully and wonderfully made.  You have created our inmost beings and knit us together in our mother's womb."

The AMA (American Medical Association) was founded in 1847.  In that year a ferry started carrying vacationers to Coney Island, New York.  Some years later, Coney Island became famous for its sideshows. Loud lettered signs crowed the the Island's attractions...tattooed ladies, sword swallowers, and even an exhibition of tiny babies.  The babies were premature infants kept alive in incubators pioneered by Dr. Martin Couney.  The AMA had rejected his incubators, but Dr. Couney didn't give up on his aims.  For over forty years. starting in 1896, he funded his work by displaying the babies and charging 25 cents to see the show.  In return, parents didn't have to pay for Dr. Couney's incubators, and many children survived who never would have had a chance otherwise.  Lucille Horn was one of them.  Born in 1920, she'd been born a twin, but her twin sister died t birth.  Her father refused to accept the Hospital Staff's advice that there wasn't a chance that Lucille would live.  He grabbed a blanket to wrap her in, hailed a taxicab, and took her to Dr. Couney's exhibit on Coney Island.  Lucille's healing was on display at the exhibit for paying customers for quite a while. It was only after six months that she finally left the incubator.  Dr. Couney died in 1950, shortly after incubators like his were introduced in most hospital.  And, Lucille Horn?  She recently went to Coney Island for a photo-op on her 96th birthday.
Love, Boppa John
