SEVENTY YEARS OF GRACE

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 2:
"Father, when we lie down to sleep, we wake again for you sustain us through the night.  We thank you, Lord, for your goodness and mercy."

I have a hard time wrapping my arms around the fact that seventy years have passed since D Day.
I had been commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in Anti Aircraft but that summer I was attending a six week course at Ft. Benning, GA on the finer points of becoming a Combat Infantry Platoon Leader.  One day I was dragging a rusty machine gun tripod up one of Georgia's red clay hills as part of a combat exercise.  Somehow, it tore through one of my pant legs and caused a small gash.  I didn't think much about it at the time but during the night I came down with a fever, so I reported on Sick Call the next morning.  As it turned out, my temperature was quite high, so an ambulance took me to the Ft. Benning hospital.  At that time, the army medics were just experimenting with penicillin and were using Sulpha
to treat infections.  They packed me down in ice and gave me a huge dose of sulpha.  That night, after they had replenished the ice, I heard two orderlies talking in the hall.  One said,  "That guy has a temperature of 105.8." to which the other replied, "Yeah, and its the same room where that other Lieutenant died when his temp hit 106."  I figured my time had come since I was only 0.2 of a degree of reaching the magic 106 temp.  But God had other plans...the next day my temperature started to come down.  Today I reflect on the difference of 0.2 degrees versus seventy years of God's Grace.  He has given me 65 years of a happy, loving marriage;  40 years working at a job that I liked very much; 28 years of an enjoyable retirement; a wonderful family that includes six great grandkids; an active church life with many great friends; and much more.  When I sing, "Count Your Many Blessings,"  I don't know where to begin.    Love,  Boppa John,
