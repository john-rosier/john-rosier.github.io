DUMP TRUMP (the CHUMP)

Dear Family,  My prayer for today comes from Psalm 3:
"Lord, we confess that we are unworthy sinners and do not deserve the goodness you shower upon us.  We give you thanks for that goodness and mercy."

At a recent debate, Donald Trump complained that the Moderators' questions were too difficult and mean spirited.  In my mind, I thought, if he should somehow win the contest for the most important office in the free world, just think about how he'd answer questions from Vladimir Putin!  I guess right now he's leading in the Republican Primary.  I think Trump just loves to come out with outlandish comments to secure better TV ratings.  Although 53% of all voters are women, Trump has a history of
calling women "fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals".  Most of his comments are aimed at getting  improved TV ratings.  As an example, after he made the comment the blood coming out of Fox News host Megyn Kelly ("blood coming out of her eyes and out of her wherever") he was booked on four Sunday TV shows, Face the Nation, Meet the Press, This Week, and State of the Union.  Those shows felt obligated to book him because (in his words) "I'm a ratings magnet."  A survey of his earlier comments demeaning Mexican Immigrants as criminals and rapists, revealed that there were less crimes committed by these immigrants than those of the current population.  Back in 1992, an independent candidate, Ross Perot, siphoned off 19% of the popular vote and muddied up the waters.  Hopefully, Trump won't take that route.  I am so sick of political TV commercials, I don't think I could survive a threefold contest.      As Columnist John Kass recently wrote, "If by some miracle Trump is the GOP nominee in 2016, all that will remain of the Republican Party will be a bleached skeleton of the elephant.  Maybe a couple buzzards."
