LEFT BRAIN/RIGHT BRAIN

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 6:                                                                                          "We praise you Lord, for you have heard our cries for mercy and you have accepted our prayers."

Last week I attended a lecture at Trinity by Dr. Ken Wasco.  Dr. Wasco travels throughout the U.S and Canada making over 150 presentations each year.  He points out the different characteristics of people who predominately use the left side of their brain as opposed to those using the right side of their brain.  This reminded me of an experience I had over 50 years ago, but I don't keep track of my snippets so I asked Grandson Jon if I had ever written about this before.  Jon has a Masters degree in Library Science and has pretty good electronic files of the printed word.  He told me that yes, I had written about this in 2011 but encouraged me to send it out again, so here goes:      In one of my evening undergrad courses at Northwestern, my Psychology Prof got a grant to do a study which could possibly help stroke victims.  The purpose was to see if after a stroke one could train the healthy side of the brain to take over some of the functions that were lost.  He needed left-handed volunteers and it sounded interesting so I agreed to report for a three-hour study on a Saturday morning.  A nurse was to attach 24 electrodes to my skull, but "First", said the Prof, "I want you to read these instructions.  No, before that, I'm going to drop this ball and ask you to kick it."  He then told me I was one of 3% of the population who were truly left-handed.He based his conclusion on my left shoulder coming forward to reach out for the instructions.  And. when I was to kick the ball, I shifted my weight to my right, anticipating a quick kick with my left foot.  After getting all wired up I had to lay on a couch in a darkened room while the Professor operated equipment in the next room and asked me questions on a two-way speaker system.  Mostly, they were of the word-association variety where I had to blurt out the first word that came to my mind, i.e. he'd say "blue" and i'd reply "yellow".  About every fifth offering from the Professor was an anxiety word.  Even today, all these years later, I can clearly remember that when he said "bowels", my first inclination was to say "Sh##", but instead I had a two-second pause and said "defecate".  After the test, he showed me how all the pens charting my brain waves would make a giant leap after each anxiety word.  I never did know if any good came from all the brain scans, but, a few months after my test the Professor shared his largess by sending me a check for about $6.00.    After Wasco's speech I told him about my long-ago-experience and he said the Neurologists are making good strides toward teaching the healthy side of the brain to take over some of the functions of the damaged side.
