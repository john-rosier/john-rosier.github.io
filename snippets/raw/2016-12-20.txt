HARRY REID'S LEGACY ASSISTS TRUMP

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 32:
"Thank you, God our Father. for instructing us and teaching us in the way we should go.  And, thank you for your counsel and watch over us"
Nevada is one of our smaller states (2,700,000 inhabitants).  Yet, one of Nevada's Senators, Harry Reid, has been the leader of the Democratic Party for the past 12 years.  Reid was a master at tactics to pass controversial bills in the U.S. Senate.  Back in 2013 Reid used a parliamentary move to change a 40-year-old Senate rule. The change means that the Senate now needs only a simple majority of 51 votes ( rather than a super majority of 60 ) to proceed to confirmation votes on Cabinet secretaries, agency directors and judges, except for the Supreme Court.  When President elect, Donald Trump looks to the Senate for confirmation of his Cabinet appointees next year, he'll have outgoing Senate Minority Leader to thank for Democratic powerlessness to block his choices.  Reid is a fierce Trump opponent who often referred to Trump as a "spoiled brat."  In a recent article in the Ne York Times, Reid wrote, "We changed the Senate rules to guarantee a President's nominees a fair simple majority vote.  I doubt any of us envisioned Donald J. Trump's becoming the first president to take office under the new rules."    This election has really  been a humdinger, right?
Love, Boppa John
