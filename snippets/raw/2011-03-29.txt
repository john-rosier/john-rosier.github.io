Letter "T"

Hi Grandkids,  My prayer today is .... Lord, I give you THANKS for 
placing me in a country and a Christian family where so many 
blessings have been given to me throughout these many years. Thank 
you, Lord!
SNIPPET: Tests.  One of my favorite courses in the MBA program was 
Psychology.  Our Professor informed us at the end of the term that 
the two top scorers for our paper would earn an A grade for the 
course and would not have to take the final exam.  I wrote on 
Proverbs 13:12, "Hope deferred maketh the heart sick."  I went all 
out to ace that paper.
I visited the Med School library and looked up quotes from well-known 
Physicians to substantiate the importance of
HOPE in the recovery rate of ailing patients.  There were plenty of 
quotes and evidence that the absence of hope is critical in a 
patient's demise.  Anyhow, when our Professor passed out our graded 
papers, he said that a "check" on the paper indicated that he had 
read he paper.  Two checks meant he read it twice.  Three checks were 
on the two winners
plus  couple of others (indicating three reads).  Guess what ... I 
had a three-read paper, but not  winner so I took the final exam. 
That was OK, I got a B+ and it was still my favorite course.  It also 
confirmed to me the on-earth-as-it-is-in-
heaven "Wisdom" of those Proverbs written thousands of years ago.   
Love,  Boppa
