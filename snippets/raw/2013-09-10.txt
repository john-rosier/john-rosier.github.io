FROM PINPOINT SIZE TO THE UNIVERSE SIZE

My prayer today comes from Psalm 89:
"Lord we praise you, for the heavens are yours and yours also is the earth; you founded the world and all that is in it."
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                A few weeks ago I saw my first butterfly of the season.  Whenever this occurs, I'm reminded of the beauty and ability of these small members of God's creation.  I read somewhere that the Monarch Butterfly migrates over 3,000 miles for its winter home in Central America.  Think of that in relation to the many weather related flight cancellations just at our OHare Airport each year!  In addition, each butterfly finds the identical tree down there that its mother and grandmother used for its residence.  And, all this is accomplished with a brain that is smaller than a pinhead!  On the other end of the spectrum of God's creation is the Universe.  In the scientific version, the observable part of our Universe is about 93 million light years in diameter and contains billions of stars.  Isn't it pathetic that the estimated
six to nine percent of our U.S. population who are Atheists are convinced that all of the above happens without a Supreme Being?  I imagine that it takes a very egotistical hombre to rely on his or her intelligence to determine that their viewpoint is far superior to the 90% who believe there is a God.      Love,  BOPPA JOHN

P.S.  Some of you have asked how i'm coping.  I'm doing well.  It's surprising to me that my Joy of the assurance that Jean is in Heaven more than offsets the Sorrow that creeps in from the reality that she's no longer here.  I attribute that blessing to the fact that all of you have been saying prayers on my behalf.  Thank you!
