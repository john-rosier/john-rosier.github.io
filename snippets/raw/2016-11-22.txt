THE GOODNESS OF GRATITUDE

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 128:
"Lord, you have promised in your word that all who fear you and who walk in your ways will be blessed, will have prosperity, and will eat the fruit of their labors."

In Galatians 5, we read, "The fruit of the Spirit is love. joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,  faithfulness, gentleness and self control."  GRATITUDE draws from love, joy, kindness and goodness.  And, when one expresses gratitude, it's a win-win outcome because both the giver and the receiver benefit.  Psychology research confirms that performing acts of kindness and sharing thankful thoughts have many positive effects on mood and health.  People who express gratitude lower their blood pressure, get better quality sleep, improve their relationships, decrease their depression levels, and are less affected by pain. When you feel thankful for things you've received or something that happened, that's gratitude.  You never feel it in a vacuum. you are clear who  or what is responsible, whether that's a loved one or a stranger.  Thanking others in heartfelt ways - or even better, helping them - carries long-lasting effects.  Canadian researchers found that people who wrote thank you letters or performed good deeds for a six-week period, decreased their pain, upped their energy, accomplished more every day, and improved  their mental health for up to six months.  One last thing, gratitude is contagious. Those who are helped are more likely to pay kindness forward.  The best news is that we can spend eternity joining the Angels in grateful praise to God the Father for all of his blessings to us,
Love, Boppa John
