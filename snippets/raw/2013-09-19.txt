The Phenomena of the ROSIER BIRDS

Hi!  I just returned from getting my blood clotting check at Dr, Khan's office.  His Nurse, Kathy, lives about three doors down from the Evergreen Park house that was our home until we moved to Palos Heights in April 1993.  She said,   
"John, you won't believe it ... the ROSIER BIRDS are back!  It's like they're giving a final salute to Jean."  Every fall for the last 5 or 6 years we lived there, a flock of hundreds of Starlings would fly in and nest in the two tall trees next to our house.  The neighbors would watch and say, "Here comes the ROSIER BIRD flock."  It was a mess.  The birds would excrete white bird poop all over the side of our house.  I tried various  ways to get rid of them.  I tied pots and pans on the branches;  I bought an air rifle and would shoot up in the tree;  I even bought two speakers which I mounted high up in the tree and would play hard rock music for hours each night.  No matter how many birds I shot or how loud I played the hard rock music, they would always get accustomed to it after about 30 minutes and come back to roost for the night.  The first Autumn after  we moved to Palos, the birds stopped coming.  Now, 20 years later they're back.  Isn't that weird?  Love, Boppa John
