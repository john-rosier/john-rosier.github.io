A LEGACY OF FIRSTS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 66:
"Lord, you have surely listened and heard our voices in prayer.  Praise be to your holy name, for you have not rejected our prayers or withheld your love from us.'

There's something exciting about the flight of a colorful, hot-air balloon.  After I retired in 1986, Jean and I spent the next 15 Januarys at John and Phyl Groot's townhouse in Palm Desert, California.  Many days at about 5:00 PM we'd see a bunch of hot-air balloons rising in the air.  Sometimes, we'd get in the car and try to arrive at their landing sites...it becomes pretty scary when  a gust of wind grabs them and the basket skids along the ground for quite a ways.  The reason I bring this up is that once a balloon aficionado told me that the very first flier was named Rosier.  I looked that up, and sure enough, on 11/21/1783, Jean-Francoise Pilatre de Rosier ascended in a hot-air balloon in Paris, flew 5 1/2 miles in 25 minutes, and descended safely.  He's credited with making the first air flight in the world.  Now that I've told you about my famous relative, here are some other "firsts".  1) In 1620, Dutch engineer, Cornelis Drebble, coated his water vessel with greased leather and made the first submarine.  2) In 1920, Earle Dickson invented the first adhesive bandage for his accident-prone wife.
3)  The invention of the printing press in 1439 revolutionized the manufacture of books. 4) The first postage stamp was issued in 1840.  5)  In 1897, German Chemist, Felix Hoffmann. synthesized the first Aspirin in his lab.  6) In 1885, Chicago constructs the first skyscraper; a ten-story, steel frame building housing the Home Insurance Company.  7) In 1971, programmer Ray Tomlinson sends the first Email with this message: QWERTYUIOP.  In the year 2015, John Rosier salutes Ray for his genius in providing an easy means of communication for staying in touch with his family each week.
