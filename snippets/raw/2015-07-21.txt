FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 90:
"Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.  Before the mountains were brought forth, the earth and the world, you are God."

For you who don't often refer to generations, here's roughly how the statisticians stack them ..SENIORS (ages over 65; BABY BOOMERS (ages 50 to 65); GEN Xers (ages 35 to 50);  and MILLENNIALS (ages under 35).  Since the U.S.A. ranks tops in the world on health expenditures, many studies have concentrated on that phase.  Out of 191 countries, the U.S. expenditure is 17.9 % of our gross national product.  More than 4 million, approximately 15 % account for almost half of medicare spending.  And, as Baby Boomers move into the Medicare years, they are - by the measure of medical diagnoses - sicker than their predecessors.  Their life spans will be older and that will cast a huge increase on our total U.S. medicare expenditure.  Generation Xers have been hit the hardest on our recent recession.  They call it the "Bermuda Triangle" of financial stressors, including student loan debt, a tepid job market and a home that may be worth less than what they paid.  They and many Boomers say credit cards function as a financial survival tool.  In a recent survey, these Gen Xers carried an average $8000 credit card debt as compared to $6,000 carried by the Boomers.  The average mortgage for Gen Xers was $144,000 as compared to $90,000 by the Boomers.  I apologize for boring you with all these percentages and figures, but I want to emphasize that the only thing that counts is God's pomise that he will be our dwelling place throughout  ALL generations.
Love, Boppa John

of Jesus.
