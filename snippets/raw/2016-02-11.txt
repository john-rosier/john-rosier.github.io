NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 86:
"Lord, you are a compassionate and generous God, slow to anger and abounding in love and faithfulness.  We will glorify your name forever."

Now that February has arrived, there's the usual breakdown on resolutions made just a short month ago (I'm going to lose 10 pounds...get at least 8 hours sleep each night...set aside time each day to read...etc).  I've discovered an effective, yet easier resolution process.  This has been popularized since 2006 in artist Ali Edwards' blog called One Little Word.  Each year she recommends choosing a word to focus on, to live with, to investigate. and to reflect on as we go about our daily lives.  As I get older and older, I'm always rushing to get things done (maybe this is reflective of the fact that my short-term memory is diminishing with each passing day).  Anyhow, my word for 2016 is PAUSE.  In a single syllable that says:  Step away, Breathe, Focus, Don't just react, Take time to choose.  It can apply to almost everything, to drinking, eating, speaking, driving,
or pressing the email "send" button.  I read about one High School English Teacher who assigned his class to pick a word, act on it for several months, then write a paper about the word and their experiences.  "At first," he reported, "the students rolled their eyes at the assignment."  And then!
"Just about every student found this paper to be the most worthwhile paper they had ever written."
So, there you have it    (and I'll pause and reread this before I hit the "send" button.)
Love, Boppa John
