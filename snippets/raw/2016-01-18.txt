RELIGIOUS WARS

Dear Family.  My prayer today comes from Psalm 150:
"Lord, we praise you for your acts of power; we praise you for your surpassing greatness."

In Christendom, Catholics and Protestants used to kill each other in what they called "Holy Wars".
About 15 years ago, Jean, Deb, Kim and I toured Zurich, Switzerland and viewed a statue of Ulrich
Zwingli.  He was a Swiss Protestant Reformer who was killed at the age of 49 while fighting the Catholics.  What a waste!  Instead of building on the meaningful shared beliefs, such as Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, both sides thought the nit-picking differences were causes worthy of killing each other.  I thought about this last week when I read that the Saudi Arabian Sunni sect executed 46 members of the Shiite sect, including Shiite Muslim cleric, Nimr al Nimr.  Just think,   
extremist Sunnis and Shiites call each other heretics, despite sharing with their counterparts the same beliefs and practices of fasting, prayer, charity and pilgrimage.  Islam is the fastest-growing
religion on the planet (currently 1.6 billion Muslims, 85% of whom are Sunnis).  According to Pew research, Muslims are expected to surpass the number of Christians to become the largest faith by 2070.  Islam's original disagreement was over the succession following the death of the prophet, Mohammed over 1,300 years ago.  Sunni's opposed a bloodline succession to Mohammed.
Disputing them were the Shiites who held to a divine order from the prophet that favored his cousin, Ali ibn Abi Talib. The murder of Ali's son, Husain, in 680 AD, further solidified the split within Islam, and that killing has been going on for all these many years.  And, the ISIS sect has stepped up the unbelievable cruelty.
Love, Boppa John
