AN ANCIENT CRAFT BREW

My prayer today comes from Psalm 62:
"Lord, we will trust in you at all times and pour out our hearts to you, for you are our refuge."

A couple of Chicago brewers have recreated a beer first produced over 1,000 years ago by a group of cloistered women atop a mountain in the Andes range of Peru.  Archeologist Ryan Williams unearthed this ancient high altitude brewery in 2004.  The Chicago brewers learned that scientists were able to reverse engineer the ancient beer recipe through a molecular analysis of the vessels used in the brewing process.  Peruvian purple corn and pink peppercorn (a berry) were the key ingredients.  The beer itself has a purple and reddish hue and contains citrus and black pepper flavors that combine for a biting character.  Beer, apparently, served an important role in the Wari Empire which existed from about 500 AD to 1000 AD.  This Wari beer is being introduced to Chicago beer lovers this week.  The article caught my attention because Jean and I had spent a day exploring Machu Picchu (old peak) during a South American trip we took in 1987.  We were amazed at the ingenuity of this Inca tribe's building skills when Machu Picchu was built back around the year 1450 AD.  It was a self-sustaining village atop a high mountain and was never discovered by the Spanish Conquistadors who plundered South America.  Isn't it amazing that a craft beer recipe outlasted a civilization that disappeared over 1,000 years ago?
