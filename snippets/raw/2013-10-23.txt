A PASTOR' STUDY

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 148:

"Lord, may we join all your angels and all your heavenly hosts in praising your name.  May the sun and moon and all the shining stars praise you."

Chicago's Garfield Park Conservatory is truly a treasure.  Jean and I always made a point of going there at least once a year.  About 7 or 8 years ago, in one of our visits, we bumped into one of our nephews, Jim Wolff.  Jim was armed with a laptop and a couple of reference books.  We asked him what was up, and he explained that he usually came there each week to work on his Sunday Sermon.  Jim has been the Pastor of Lawndale C.R.C. (an inner-city church) for over 32 years and when in his office he usually gets interrupted  many times each hour.  Since the Garfield Conservatory is only a couple of miles from his church, Jim can do a much better job of creating a sermon in the quiet surroundings of all those beautiful plants and flowers.  Garfield first opened to the public in 1874, just nine years after the Civil War.  At that time it was named Central Park, but the new name began in 1881, the year President Garfield
was assassinated.  Jim's "study" took a massive hit on June 30, 2011.  A freak hail storm rained down huge hail stones that damaged over 70% of the panes in the Greenhouses.  It's a good thing that the storm struck at the onset of summer or the plant damage would have been more severe.  When construction crews began replacing the broken panes, they found that much of the steel super structure was corroded and also had to be replaced.  In spite of the
Recession, millions of dollars were spent to fully restore the beauty of Garfield, the world's largest conservatory (and a
much appreciated Pastor's Study).  Love,  Boppa John
