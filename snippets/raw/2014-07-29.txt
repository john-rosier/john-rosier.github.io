EMPLOYMENT FOR THE BLIND

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 91:
"Lord, you will give your Angels charge over us to guard us in all our ways.  They will lift us up in their hands to keep us from striking our feet upon the stones."

As most of you know, mailing lists of charitable donors are sold to other charities.  I have a friend who works in this field and he knows of one charity that makes over $500,000 annually via the sale of their mailing lists.  I can't remember how I first donated to charities for the blind years ago, but I now give to
The National Federation For The Blind,  Orbis,  Braille Books For Blind Children, and the 20/20/20 Organization.  What brought this to mind, I just found out this week that the pen issued to me in WWII was assembled by a blind person.  When I was a High School Sophomore  in 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law a requirement that the federal government purchase specific goods manufactured by blind Americans.  This was in the midst of our great depression when jobs were scarce and blind persons were already at a competitive disadvantage.  Today, the Skilcraft Company produces an arsenal of office supplies and employs over 5,500 blind workers in 37 states.  Just the pens alone account for $5 million each year with 60 percent going to the military.  Like all government purchases, the pens must be produced by specifications  (for this item, it's a 16 page document that was first written more that 50 year ago.)  Among the requirements?  The pens must be able to write continuously for no less than 5,000 feet and in temperatures up to 160 degrees and down to 40 degrees below zero.  You know, just in case.  It's fun making jokes about our government's bureaucratic overkill...but that 1938
law did prove to be a very worthwhile act of kindness.  Since then, eleven Presidents have come and gone, but the pen made by the blind has endured.            Love,  Boppa John
