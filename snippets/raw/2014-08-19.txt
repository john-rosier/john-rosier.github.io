PORK BARREL SPENDING

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 110:
" Lord, we long for that day when your people shall come to you willingly, dressed in holy altar robes.
Father, thank you for your faithfulness!"

When I was raised on a farm for the first 13 years of my life, my toilet facilities were very primitive.  I
survived OK but I can still recall the harshness of those cold winter days and the harshness of the shiny pages of an outdated Sears catalogue used in pre Charmin years.  What brings this in focus is an article I read this morning about a $99,000 outhouse which will sit at a trailhead in Alaska's Denali National Park.  This single toilet with no internal plumbing costs $10,000, but because the Interior Department contracted with a local business that ordered it from an Oregon manufacturer, shipping and other costs added $89,000 to the fee.  Pork barrel "earmarks" are used a lot by Alaskan Senators.  I'm sure most of you have heard of the $398,000,000 "Bridge to Nowhere" which would connect Ketchican to its International Airport to avoid the inconvenience of using ferries.  (Ketchican's population is 8,500 and that's roughly one third of Evergreen Park, IL where I grew up).  Luckily, Congress has put the bridge construction on hold, but they did allocate $23 million to build an unused road from the airport to the water's edge where the bridge would be positioned.  And, 33 years ago Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens pushed an earmark through Congress that forces the U.S, Postal service to absolve most of the shipping charges to remote Eskimo villages located in the Bush Country.  Just in 2013 it cost the Postal
service an extra $77.5 million to handle these remote shipments.  Retailers pay the Government about half of what they'd have to pay to ship the goods commercially.  It all boils down to Pork Barrel spending eating up our hard-earned income with extra taxes and higher costs of postage.  What else is new?
Love, Boppa John
