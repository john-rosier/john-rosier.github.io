BULLET TRAINS

Dear Family,  My prayer today comes from Psalm 114:
"Glorify your name, O Lord, not ours.  Cause everyone to praise your truth and lovingkindness."

There was an article in last week's paper about a man setting himself on fire while traveling on a Japanese Bullet Train.  The article caught my eye because Jean and I and some of her family rode on one of these trains back in May of 1987.  At that time, these trains averaged  speed of 150 to 160 miles per hour.  Nowadays, their average speed is 200 MPH.  This guy's suicide also killed a fellow traveler and it was the deadliest incident in the 51-year history of Japan's famed "Shinkansen" railway.  Just think, these trains have carried over 51 billion passengers in that time and in spite of Japanese earthquakes and torrential storms, they have never had a fatality.  The trains have very comfortable seating and terrific schedule.  During the morning and evening rush hours, the are scheduled every ten minutes.  The average train has a total seating capacity of 1,300 and has16 cars.  Another impressive feature is the honesty of the Japanese commuters.  At each station there are hundreds and hundreds of bicycles and motorcycles...and none of them are locked!  Our group got off one day at Tabor, and Uncle Wendy left his expensive jacket on the train.  Our train had one more stop and then headed back to Osaka.  We were staying at a hotel that was very popular with American tourists.  On the train's stop at Tabor on the way back, the conductor sent Wendy's jacket back to our hotel and within about an hour, Wendy had his jacket back.  Wendy was spared from dying when two Japanese Kamikaze suicide planes hit his ship in 1945 and then spared from losing his jacket 42 years later by honest Japanese citizens...sometimes it's difficult for our weak brains to grasp, but like that famous hymn begins:  "God moves in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform."
Love, Boppa John
