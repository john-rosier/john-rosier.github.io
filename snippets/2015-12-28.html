      <p>The Spanish have named this climate phenomenon EL NINO (The Christ Child) because it usually arrives around Christmas.  And, since climate experts say this year's EL NINO may become the strongest ever, I thought it should be the subject of today's snippet.  The effects of our current        EL NINO are expected to last through May and promises a torrent of extreme events, including draught and heavy rain, famine and flooding.  EL NINO is a semi regular event, triggered when sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean rise by an average of at least 0.9 F for three straight months.  The warmer water changes how air circulates around the globe, altering day-to-day weather patterns.During our past autumn, sea surface temperatures rose more than 3.6 F above baseline levels...enough to guarantee that this EL NINO will be historic.  The effects of EL NINO vary dramatically from place to place.  Dry conditions that lead to draught tend to persist in Southeast Asia, Australia and southern Africa.  Torrential rain usually strikes parts of North and South America. But, while these weather events may differ with location, temperatures will remain consistently above average around the globe.  Experts predict that 2016 will be the hottest year on record.  After all these years since God created our universe, isn't it amazing how he still fine tunes the year-to-year variations in his creation?</p>

      <p>I wish all of you a blessed and Happy New Year.</p>
